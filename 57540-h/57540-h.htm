  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the following pages I have endeavored with the greatest
brevity to supply the learner with the elements necessary for a
study of the native hieroglyphic writing of Central America.
The material is already so ample that in many directions I have
been obliged to refer to it, rather than to summarize it. This
will explain various omissions which may be noted by advanced
scholars; but they will not, I believe, diminish the usefulness
of the work as an elementary treatise.</p>

<p class='c000'>In conclusion I would express my thanks to the officers of
the Bureau of American Ethnology, Washington, and of the Peabody
Museum of Archæology, Cambridge, for various facilities
they have obligingly furnished me.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>I. Introductory.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The explorations among the ruined cities of Central America
undertaken of late years by various individuals and institutions
in the United States and Europe, and the important collections
of casts, tracings and photographs from those sites now on view
in many of the great museums of the world, are sure to stimulate
inquiry into the meaning of the hieroglyphs which constitute
so striking a feature on these monuments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within the last decade decided advances have been made
toward an interpretation of this curious writing; but the results
of such studies are widely scattered and not readily accessible
to American students. For these reasons I propose, in the
present essay, to sum up briefly what seem to me to be the most
solid gains in this direction; and to add from my own studies
additional suggestions toward the decipherment of these unique
records of aboriginal American civilization.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>1. <i>General Character of Mayan Hieroglyphs.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>One and the same hieroglyphic system is found on remains
from Yucatan, Tabasco, Chiapas, Guatemala, and Western Honduras;
in other words, in all Central American regions occupied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>at the Conquest by tribes of the Mayan linguistic stock.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> It
has not been shown to prevail among the Huastecan branch of
that stock, which occupied the valley of the river Panuco, north
of Vera Cruz; and, on the other hand, it has not been discovered
among the remains of any tribe not of Mayan affinities.
The Mexican manuscripts offer, indeed, a valuable ancillary
study. They present analogies and reveal the early form of
many conventionalized figures; but to take them as interpreters
of Mayan graphography, as many have done, is a fatal error of
method. In general character and appearance the Mayan is
markedly different from the Mexican writing, presenting a much
more developed style and method.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the graphic elements preserved in the manuscripts
and on the monuments vary considerably among themselves,
these divergencies are not so great but that a primitive identity
of elements is demonstrable in them all. The characters
engraved on stone or wood, or painted on paper or pottery,
differ only as we might expect from the variation in the material
or the period, and in the skill or fancy of the artist.</p>

<p class='c000'>The simple elements of the writing are not exceedingly
numerous. There seems an endless variety in the glyphs or
characters; but this is because they are composite in formation,
made up of a number of radicals, variously arranged; as with
the twenty-six letters of our alphabet we form thousands of words
of diverse significations. If we positively knew the meaning or
meanings (for, like words, they often have several different meanings)
of a hundred or so of these simple elements, none of the
inscriptions could conceal any longer from us the general tenor
of its contents.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>It will readily be understood that the composite characters
may be indefinitely numerous. Mr. Holden found that in all
the monuments portrayed in Stephen’s <cite>Travels in Central America</cite>
there are about fifteen hundred;<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and Mr. Maudslay has informed
me that according to his estimate there are in the Dresden
Codex about seven hundred.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each separate group of characters is called a “glyph,” or, by
the French writers, a “katun,” the latter a Maya word applied to
objects arranged in rows, as soldiers, letters, years, cycles, etc.
As the glyphs often have rounded outlines, like the cross-section
of a pebble, the Mayan script has been sometimes called “calculiform
writing” (Latin, <i>calculus</i>, a pebble).</p>

<h3 class='c012'>2. <i>The Mayan Manuscripts or “Codices.”</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The hieroglyphic writing is preserved to us on two classes of
remains—painted on sheets of native paper, about ten inches
wide and of any desired length, which were inscribed on both
sides and folded in the manner of a screen; and engraved or
painted on stone, wood, pottery, or plaster.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Of the former only four examples remain, none of them perfect.
They have all been published with great care, some of
them in several editions. They are usually spoken of as “codices”
under the following names: the <cite>Codex Troanus</cite> and the
<cite>Codex Cortesianus</cite>, probably parts of the same book, the original
of which is at Madrid; the <cite>Codex Peresianus</cite>, which is in Paris;
and the <cite>Codex Dresdensis</cite>, in Dresden. The two former and the
two latter resemble each other more closely than they do either
member of the other pair. There are reasons to believe that
the two first mentioned were written in central Yucatan, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>last two in or near Tabasco.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a> This district and that of Chiapas,
adjacent to it on the south, was occupied at the time of the Conquest
by the Tzental-Zotzil branch of the Mayan stock, who spoke
a dialect very close to the pure Maya of Yucatan; they were the
descendants of the builders of the imposing cities of Palenque,
Ococingo, Toniná and others, and we know that their culture,
mythology, and ritual were almost identical with those of the
Mayas. I shall treat of them, therefore, as practically one people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although Lord Kingsborough had included the Dresden
Codex in his huge work on “<cite>Mexican Antiquities</cite>,” and the
<cite>Codex Troanus</cite> had been published with close fidelity by the
French government in 1869, it cannot be said that the serious
study of the Mayan hieroglyphs dates earlier than the faithful
edition of the Dresden Codex, issued in 1880 under the supervision
of Dr. E. W. Förstemann, librarian-in-chief of the Royal
Library of Saxony.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most important studies of the codices have been published
in Germany. Besides the excellent writings of Dr.
Förstemann himself, those by Dr. P. Schellhas and Dr. E.
Seler, of Berlin, are of great utility and will be frequently
referred to in these pages. In France, Professor Leon de Rosny,
the competent editor of the <cite>Codex Peresianus</cite>, the Count de
Charencey, and M. A. Pousse, whose early death was a severe
loss to this branch of research, deserve especial mention. In
England no one has paid much attention to it but Mr. Alfred P.
Maudslay, whose investigations have yielded valuable results,
forerunners of others of the first importance. The earlier
speculations of Bollaert are wholly fanciful. In our own country,
the mathematical portions of the essays of Professor Cyrus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Thomas are worthy of the highest praise; and useful suggestions
can be found in Charles Rau’s article on the inscriptions of
Palenque, and in Edward S. Holden’s paper on Central American
picture-writing.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>3. <i>Theories of Interpretation.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The theories which have been advanced as to the method of
interpreting the Mayan hieroglyphs may be divided into those
which regard them as ideographic, as phonetic, or as mixed.
The German writers, Förstemann, Schellhas, and Seler, have
maintained that they are mainly or wholly ideographic; the
French school, headed by the Abbé Brasseur, de Rosny, and
de Charencey, have regarded them as largely phonetic, in which
they have been followed in the United States by Professor Cyrus
Thomas, Dr. Cresson, Dr. Le Plongeon, and others.</p>

<p class='c000'>The intermediate position, which I have defended, is that while
chiefly ideographic, they are occasionally phonetic, in the same
manner as are confessedly the Aztec picture-writings. In these
we constantly meet with delineations of objects which are not
to be understood as conveying the idea of the object itself, but
merely as representing the sound of its name, either in whole or
in part; just as in our familiar “rebus writing,” or in the
“chanting arms” of European heraldry. I have applied to this
the term “ikonomatic writing,” and have explained it so fully, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>it is found in the Mexican manuscripts, in my “<cite>Essays of an
Americanist</cite>,” that I need not enter upon it further in this connection,
but would refer the reader to what I have there written.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The attempt to frame a real alphabet, by means of which the
hieroglyphs could be read phonetically, has been made by
various writers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first is that preserved in the work of Bishop Landa. It
has failed to be of much use to modern investigators, but it has
peculiar value as evidence of two facts; first, that a native scribe
was able to give a written character for an unfamiliar sound, one
without meaning, like that of the letters of the Spanish alphabet;
and, secondly, that the characters he employed for this purpose
were those used in the native manuscripts. This is proof that
some sort of phonetic writing was not unknown.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This alphabet was extended by the Abbé Brasseur, and
especially by de Rosny, who, in 1883, defined twenty-nine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>letters, with numerous variants from the Codices and inscriptions.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Two years later, Dr. A. Le Plongeon published an “Ancient
Maya Hieratic Alphabet according to Mural Inscriptions,” containing
twenty-three letters, with variants. This he applied to
the translating of certain inscriptions, but added nothing to corroborate
the correctness of the interpretations. Each sign, he
believed, stood for a definite letter.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 1.</span>—Landa’s Alphabet; after a photograph from the original manuscript.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Another student who devoted several years to an attempt to
reduce the hieroglyphs to an alphabetic form was the late Dr.
Hilborne T. Cresson. His theory was that the glyphs stood for
the names of pictures worn down to a single phonetic element,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>alphabetic or syllabic. This element he conceived was consonantal,
to be read with any vowel, either prefixed or suffixed;
and the consonant was permutable with any of its class, as a
lingual, palatal, etc. On this basis he submitted, shortly before
his death in 1894, to the American Association for the Advancement
of Science several translations from the Codex Troano.
Previous to this, in 1892, he had announced his method in the
journal “<cite>Science</cite>,” and claimed that he had worked it out ten
years before.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>An alphabet of twenty-seven characters, with variants, which
the author considered in every way complete, was published in
1888, by F. A. de la Rochefoucauld.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> By means of it he offered
a volume of interlinear translations from the inscriptions and
codices! They are in the highest degree fanciful, and can have
little interest other than as a warning against the intellectual
aberrations to which students of these ancient mysteries seem
peculiarly prone.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1892 Professor Cyrus Thomas, of the Bureau of Ethnology,
announced with considerable emphasis that he had discovered
the “key” to the Mayan hieroglyphs; and in July, 1893, published
a detailed description and applications of it.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a> In theory,
it is the same as Dr. Cresson’s, that is, that the elements of the
glyphs were employed as true phonetic elements, or letters. In
the article referred to he gives the characters for the following
letters of the Maya alphabet: <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c’</i>, <i>dz</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>,
<i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>pp</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>tz</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>z</i>; also for a large number of syllabic
sounds which he claimed to have recognized. With such an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>apparatus, if it had any value, one would expect to reach prompt
and important results; but, aside from the doubtful character of
many of his analyses, the fact that this “key” has wholly failed
to add any tangible, valuable addition to our knowledge of the
inscriptions is enough to show its uselessness; and the same may
be said of all the attempts mentioned.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c000'>A slight inspection of the Maya manuscripts and of almost
any of the inscriptions will satisfy the observer that they are
made up of three classes of objects or elements:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Arithmetical signs, numerals, and numerical computations,</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Pictures or figures of men, animals, or fantastic beings, of
ceremonies or transactions, and of objects of art or utility; and,</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Simple or composite characters, plainly intended for graphic
elements according to some system for the preservation of
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall refer to these as, (1) the Mathematical Elements, (2) the
Pictorial Elements, and (3) the Graphic Elements of the Mayan
hieroglyphic writing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>II. The Mathematical Elements.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>1. <i>The Codices as Time-Counts.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>In another work I have explained the numeral system in vogue
among the ancient Mayas, as well as the etymology of the terms
they employed.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> It will be sufficient, therefore, to say here that
their system was vigesimal, proceeding by multiples of twenty
up to very large sums. In the same work I have quoted from
original sources the information that the fives up to fifteen were
represented by single straight lines and the intermediate numbers
by dots. This has also been discovered independently by several
students of the manuscripts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The frequency and prominence of these elementary numerals in
nearly every relic of Mayan writing, whether on paper, stone, or
pottery, constitute a striking feature of such remains, and forcibly
suggest that by far the majority of them have one and the same
purpose, that is, <i>counting</i>; and when we find with almost equal
frequency the signs for days and months associated with these
numerals, we become certain that in these records we have before
us <i>time-counts</i>—some sort of ephemerides or almanacs. This is
true of all the Codices, and of nine out of ten of the inscriptions.
Here, therefore, is a first and most important step gained toward
the solution of the puzzle before us.</p>

<p class='c000'>But did this incessant time-counting refer to the past or to
the future? Was it history or was it prophecy? Or, passing
beyond this world, was it astronomy? Was it mythology or
ritual, the epochs and the eons of the gods? Perhaps the disposition,
sequence, and values of the numbers themselves, once
comprehended, will answer these vital questions.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>2. <i>The Mayan Numeral System.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Unfortunately, the old writers, either Spanish or native, tell us
little about Maya mathematics. They say the computation ran
thus:—</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>20 units</td>
    <td class='c017'>= one <i>kal</i>, 20.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>20 <i>kal</i></td>
    <td class='c017'>= one <i>bak</i>, 400.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>20 <i>bak</i></td>
    <td class='c017'>= one <i>pic</i>, 8000.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>20 <i>pic</i></td>
    <td class='c017'>= one <i>calab</i>, 160,000.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>20 <i>calab</i></td>
    <td class='c017'>= one <i>kinchil</i> or <i>tzotzceh</i>, 3,200,000.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>20 <i>kinchil</i></td>
    <td class='c017'>= one <i>alau</i>, 64,000,000.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>The Tzental system was the same, though the terms differed
somewhat: 20 units = one <i>tab</i> (cord or net-ful); 20 <i>tabs</i> = one
<i>bac</i>; 20 <i>bacs</i> = one <i>bac-baquetic</i> (bundle of bacs); 20 <i>bac-baquetics</i>
= one <i>mam</i> (grandfather); 20 <i>mams</i> = one <i>mechun</i> (grandmother);
20 <i>mechuns</i> = one <i>mucul mam</i> (great-grandfather),
64,000,000.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>No doubt in the numerical notation there were special signs
for each of these higher unities; but neither Bishop Landa nor
the native writers who composed the singular “Books of Chilan
Balam” have handed them down. Modern sagacity, however,
has repaired ancient negligence, and we can, almost to a certainty,
restore the numerical notation of the aboriginal arithmeticians.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scholar who has worked most successfully in this field is
Dr. Förstemann, the editor of the Codex of Dresden, and I shall
introduce a condensed statement of his results, referring the
student to his own writings for their demonstration.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>3. <i>Numerical and Allied Signs.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The first important discovery of Dr. Förstemann in this direction
was that of the sign for the naught or cipher, 0. It is
given in Fig. <a href='#fig_2'>2</a>.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a> It has a number of variants, some ornamental
in design. Next, he discovered the system of notation of high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>numbers. This is not like ours, but resembles that in use in the
arithmetic of ancient Babylonia and some parts of China. The
numerals are arranged in columns, to be read from below upward,
the value of each unit of a given number being that power of 20
which corresponds to the line on which it stands counted from
the bottom. This will be readily understood from the following
example:—</p>

<p class='c000'>This would be according to the regular system of the Maya
numeration as given above; but in applying it to the calculations
of the native astronomer who wrote the Dresden Manuscript,
Dr. Förstemann discovered a notable peculiarity which
may extend over all that class of literature. In the third line from
the bottom, where in accordance with the above rule the unit is
valued at 20 × 20 = 400, its actual value is 20 × 18 = 360.</p>

<p class='c000'>It immediately suggested itself to him that in time-counts this
irregular value was assigned in order that the series might be
brought into relation to the old solar year of 360 days, composed
of 18 months of 20 days each, in the native calendar.</p>

<p class='c000'>An examination of the mural inscriptions showed that on
them also the same plan for the expression of high numbers had
been employed, and Dr.
Förstemann was enabled
to interpret with
accuracy the computations
on the monuments
from Copan, Quirigua,
and Palenque; developing
incidentally the remarkable fact that the inscriptions of
Copan contain as a rule higher numbers and are therefore presumably
of later date than those of Palenque. The highest is
that on “Stela N,” as catalogued by Mr. Maudslay, which
ascends to 1,414,800 days, or 3930 years of 360 days.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The next step was the identification of the graphic signs for

<p class='c000'>That generally used for 20 was identified by several students.
It is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_3'>3</a>, No. 3; another also employed under certain

<p class='c000'>The signs for the <i>bak</i>, 360, and the <i>pic</i>, 7200, are not so

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Higher signs than these in the direct numerical scale have not
yet been ascertained; but such plausible reasons have been
advanced by Dr. Förstemann for assigning calendar values to
certain other signs that they should be added in this description
of the numerals.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first is that shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_4'>4</a>, No. 8. It represents the
katunic cycle of 52 years of 365 days each, = 18,980 days. The
second is No. 9. This is taken to be the sign of the <i>ahau katun</i>,
24 years of 365 days, = 8760 days. The third is No. 10. This
corresponds to one-third of an <i>ahau katun</i>, = 2920 days.  The
fourth, shown No. 11, is an old cycle of 20 years of 360 days, =
7200. No. 12 means an old katunic cycle of 52 years of 360
days, = 18,720 days, and No. 13 an old year of 360 days.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There are also a series of other signs evidently connected with
the numerals, the precise value of which is yet undetermined.
One of these is a small right or oblique cross, or sometimes two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>arcs abutting against each other, connected or not. It is usually
by the side of a single dot or unit, or between two such. In
certain places, it seems to be a multiplier with the value 20; in
others, it would indicate a change or alternation in the series
presented of days or years. (See Fig. <a href='#fig_5'>5</a>, Nos. 1–4.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Of somewhat similar value are the calendar signs <img src='images/illus-023a.jpg' alt='' class='ig' />, Fig. <a href='#fig_4'>4</a>,
Nos. 2, 3, 4, like an <i>S</i> placed lengthwise.
This is also understood to be a sign of
alternation or change of series of years or
cycles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of an opposite sense is the sign No.
5, the spiral, and also the sign No. 1, both
of which are held to represent union.</p>

<p class='c000'>This list exhausts the mathematical
signs so far as they have been ascertained
with probability. Those for high numbers
brought forward by Brasseur,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a> have no
evidence in their favor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Maudslay has offered reasons for
believing that the character in Fig. <a href='#fig_6'>6</a>, <i>a</i>,
stands for the numeral 20 in a certain
class of mural inscriptions.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a> He further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>points out that the character <i>b</i> is not unfrequently united with
<i>a</i>, and that it (<i>b</i>) almost alone of the mural glyphs is found
with a double set of numerals attached to it as in <i>c</i>. One or
both these sets of numerals are at times replaced by the sign <i>a</i>,
giving the composites <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>f</i>. It is thus evident that <i>a</i> has
some numerical or calendar meaning. As a character itself, it
is the “cosmic sign,” conveying the idea of the world or universe
as a whole, as is seen by the examples to which Mr.
Maudslay refers, from various Codices. The cross-hatching
upon it means, as I shall show later, “strong, mighty,” and is
merely a superlative. It may very well mean 20, as that is the
number conveying completeness or perfection in this mythology.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
That it appears on what Mr. Maudslay calls the
“Initial Series” of glyphs (which I consider terminals), is explained
by the nature of the computations they preserve.
Another combination, belonging most likely to a similar class,
is the following <img src='images/illus-024.jpg' alt='' class='ig' /> where the “cosmic sign” is united
as a superfix to the <i>pax</i> and the flint. It has usually been explained
as a “phallic emblem,” and by Thomas as “tortillas.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>4. <i>The Rhetorical and Symbolic Use of Numbers.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>In the old Maya language we find that certain numbers were
used in a rhetorical sense, and this explains their appearance in
some non-mathematical portions of the Codices and inscriptions.
The two most commonly employed were 9 and 13. These conveyed
the ideas of indefinite greatness, of superlative excellence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of infinity, etc. A very lucky man was a “nine-souled man;”
that which had existed forever was “thirteen generations old,”
etc. The “demon with thirteen powers” was still prominent in
Tzental mythology in the time of Nuñez de la Vega. Other
numerals occasionally employed in a symbolic sense were 3,
4, and 7.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>All these occur in the Codices as prefixes in relations where
they are not to be construed in their arithmetical values, but in
those assigned them by the usages of the language or the customs
of religious symbolism. Thus, “twenty,” owing to the
vigesimal method of numeration, conveyed the associated ideas
of completeness and perfection; and as the month of 20 days
was divided into four equal parts of 5 days each, by which markets,
etc., were assigned, these numbers also stood independently
for other concepts than those of computation.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>5. <i>The Mayan Methods of Counting Time.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>Having ascertained the characters for the numerals, and having
learned that these records are mainly time-counts, the next
question which arises is: How did the Mayas count time?</p>

<p class='c000'>About this we have considerable information from the works
of the Spanish writers, Landa, Aguilar, Cogolludo, Pio Perez,
etc., which has been supplemented by the researches of modern
authors.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Maya system was a complicated one, based on several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>originally distinct methods, which it was the duty and the aim
of the astronomer-priests to bring into unison,—and the effort
to accomplish this will chiefly explain their elaborate computations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Undoubtedly their earliest time-count was that common to
primitive tribes everywhere—a measurement of the solar year
by lunations or “moons.” The exact lunar month is 29 days,
12 hours, 44 minutes, 3 seconds; but primitive peoples usually
estimate it at 28 days, and allow 13 months to the solar year, as
do yet many North Asiatic peoples, and as probably did the
early Aryans;<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a> or, they estimate the “moon” at 30 days, and
allow 12 moons to the year. There are good grounds for believing
that the Mayan tribes were at one time divided in custom
about this, some using one, some the other method. At the
time of the Conquest they had undoubtedly reached a knowledge
of the length of the year as 365 days; and there is
considerable probability that some of them at least made the
correction arranged for in our bissextile or leap year.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This is all familiar enough and would create no difficulty in
deciphering these aboriginal almanacs; but a disturbing element
enters. The real time-count by which they adjusted the important
events of their lives, and which is most prominent in
their records, had nothing to do with the motions of the sun, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the moon, or any other natural phenomenon. It was based on
purely mythical relations supposed to exist between man and
nature. As the number 20 (fingers and toes) completes the
man, and as all the directions, that is, potencies, of the visible
and invisible worlds were held to be 13, these two numbers, 13
and 20, formed the basis of an astrological and ritual calendar,
by which auspicious and inauspicious days were assigned, future
events foretold, the major feasts and festivals of religious worship
dictated, and the like.</p>

<p class='c000'>This singular time-count of 20 × 13 = 260 days was adopted
with slight variations by every semi-civilized nation of Mexico
and Central America, and even the names of the 20 days are
practically of the same meaning in all these languages.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a> It
constituted the <i>tonalamatl</i> of the Nahuas, the “Book of Days,”
used in divination.</p>

<p class='c000'>This sacred period was subdivided into four equal parts of 65
days each, each of which was assigned to the rule of a special
planet or star, and to a particular cardinal point with attendant
divinities; and each was marked with a color of its own, white,
black, red, or blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each “month” of 20 days was subdivided into four periods of
five days each, again each having its own divinity, assignment, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the importance to us of the <i>tonalamatl</i> is that its computations
underlay the measurement of long periods of time, the
less and greater cycles. These were estimated by the methods
of the sacred year, in groups of 13, 20, 24, 52, 104, 260 years,
etc. These irregular numbers had to be brought into unison
with the lunar and solar years, with the vigesimal system of
counting by 20 and its multiples, and with the observed motions
of the planets, who were divinities controlling the ritual divisions
of time.</p>

<p class='c000'>To devise a mathematical method of equalities and differences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>by which these conflicting numbers could be placed in harmonious
relations, subsumed under common measures, and the
ceremonies and forecasts which they controlled assigned by
uniform laws—this is the arithmetical problem which fills the
pages of the Mayan Codices, and in parts or at length is spread
over the surface of the inscribed monuments and painted vases.
We need not search for the facts of history, the names of mighty
kings, or the dates of conquests. We shall not find them.
Chronometry we shall find, but not chronicles; astronomy with
astrological aims; rituals, but no records. Pre-Columbian
history will not be reconstructed from them. This will be
a disappointment to many; but it is the conclusion toward
which tend all the soundest investigations of recent years.</p>

had to deal with and adjust under some scheme of uniformity:—</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>6. <i>The Calculations in the Codices.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Codices contain numerous calculations intended to bring
these various quantities into definite relations as aliquot parts
of some arithmetical whole, which might be taken as a general
unit. The scribes appear to have begun by establishing a period
of 14,040 days. This equals 39 years of 360 days each, and
also 54 years of 260 days each, together, of course, with the
divisors of these numbers, 13, 18, 20, 65, etc. Then followed the
determination of the period of 18,980 days, = 73 <i>tonalamatl</i>, =
52 solar years, so prominent in the calendar and ritual of the
Nahuas.</p>

<p class='c000'>This number, however, could not be adjusted to the cycle of
the <i>ahau katun</i>, which was 24 years of 365 days each;<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a> nor to
the ceremonially prominent revolution of “the Great Star,” Venus,
which coincides with the Earth’s revolutions in 2920 days, or eight
solar years. To bring these into accord with the <i>tonalamatl</i>
required a period of 104 solar years, or 37,960 days; and to
adjust under one number the <i>katuns</i>, the <i>ahau katuns</i>, the revolutions
of Venus, the solar year, and the <i>tonalamatl</i>, three times
that number of days are required, that is, 113,880, = 312 years.</p>

<p class='c000'>This period had still to be brought into relation to the old
year of 360 days, and this requires the estimation of a term
covering 1,366,560 days, or 3744 years; and this extended era
we find expressed in the Dresden Codex, page 24, in the
following simple notation, the interpretation of which into our
system of calculation, according to the method above explained,
I add to the right.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>This long period allowed all their important time-measures
to be dealt with as aliquot parts of one whole, and would seem
to be sufficient for the purposes they had in view. The credit
of establishing it from their ancient writings is exclusively due
to Dr. Förstemann, whose demonstrations of it appear to be
conclusive.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This acute observer has, however, discovered some reasons
to suppose that the native priests occasionally contemplated a
much more extended era; some of their calculations seem to
require an era which embraced 12,299,040 days, that is, 33,696
years!<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>No doubt each of these periods of time had its appropriate
name in the technical language of the Maya astronomers, and
also its corresponding sign or character in their writing. None
of them has been recorded by the Spanish writers; but from the
analogy of the Nahuatl script and language, and from certain
indications in the Maya writings, we may surmise that some of
these technical terms were from one of the radicals meaning “to
tie, or fasten together,” and that the corresponding signs would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>either directly, that is, pictorially; or ikonomatically, that is, by
similarity of sound, express this idea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Proceeding on the first of these suppositions, Dr. Förstemann
has suggested that the character, Fig. <a href='#fig_4'>4</a>, No. 8, signifies the
period of 52 years, the Nahuatl <i>xiuhmolpilli</i>, “the tying together
of the years,” represented in the Aztec pictographs by a bundle
of faggots tied with cords. The Maya figure is explained as the
day-sign <i>imix</i>, representing the first day of the calendar, and, by
a kind of synecdoche, the whole calendar, with a superfix.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>7. <i>Rules for Tracing the Tonalamatl, or Ritual Calendar.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>That the computations of the <i>tonalamatl</i> underlie most of the
numerals in the Codices is shown by the rules for reading them,
formulated by Pousse with reference to the red and black
numerical signs. These rules are as follows:—<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>1. If to a red number be added the black number immediately
following it, the total less 13 (or its multiples, when the total is
above 13) equals the next following red number.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. When the red and black numbers are written alternately on
the same line, they are to be read from left to right; when written
one above the other, they are to be read from below upward; when
in two vertical columns, they are to be read passing from one
column to the other, beginning with the first black number on
the left, passing to the first black number on the right, returning
to the second black number on the left, and so on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sequences of this kind are governed by the following
rules:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. In any of the above systems the beginning is always marked
by one or more columns of days surmounted by a number.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. This number is always the same as that which ends the
series, and both are written in red.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The sum of the numbers written in black, multiplied by
the number of days with different names represented by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>hieroglyphs attached, always equals 260, that is, the number of
days in the <i>tonalamatl</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The above rules enable the student to recognize the relations
of the different parts of the Codices. They prove, for instance,
that the pages are not to be read from top to bottom, but that the
separate parts or chapters are to be read in many instances from
left to right in the section of the page in which they begin,
without respect to the folds of the MSS.; and that evidently in
reading these “books” they were unfolded and spread out. A
good example of this is in Cod. Dresden, pages 4–10, on which
one chapter covers all the upper thirds of the seven pages.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>8. <i>The Codices as Astronomical Treatises.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>A careful examination of Dr. Förstemann’s remarkable studies,
as well as a number of other considerations drawn from the
Codices themselves, have persuaded me that the general purpose
of the Codices and the greater inscriptions, as those of Palenque,
have been misunderstood and underrated by most writers. In
one of his latest papers<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Professor Cyrus Thomas says of the
Codices: “These records are to a large extent only religious calendars;”
and Dr. Seler has expressed his distrust in Dr. Förstemann’s
opinions as to their astronomic contents. My own conviction
is that they will prove to be much more astronomical
than even the latter believes; that they are primarily and
essentially records of the motions of the heavenly bodies; and
that both figures and characters are to be interpreted as referring
in the first instance to the sun and moon, the planets, and
those constellations which are most prominent in the nightly sky
in the latitude of Yucatan.</p>

<p class='c000'>This conclusion is entirely in accordance with the results of the
most recent research in neighboring fields of American culture.
The profound studies of the Mexican Calendar undertaken by
Mrs. Zelia Nuttall have vindicated for it a truly surprising accuracy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>which could have come only from prolonged and accurately
registered observations of the relative apparent motions of
the celestial bodies.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a> We may be sure that the Mayas were not
behind the Nahuas in this; and in the grotesque figures and
strange groupings which illustrate the pages of their books we
should look for pictorial representations of astronomic events.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, as everywhere else, with this serious astronomic
lore were associated notions of astrology, dates for fixing rites
and ceremonies, mythical narratives, cosmogonical traditions
and liturgies, incantations and prescriptions for religious functions.
But through this maze of superstition I believe we can
thread our way if we hold on to the clue which astronomy can
furnish us. In the present work, however, I do not pretend to
more than prepare the soil for such a labor.</p>

<p class='c000'>A proof of the correctness of this opinion and also an admirable
example of the success with which Dr. Förstemann has
prosecuted his analysis of the astronomical meaning of the
Codices is offered by his explanation of the 24th page of the
Dresden Codex, laid before the International Congress of
Americanists, in 1894.</p>

<p class='c000'>He showed that it was intended to bring the time covered in
five revolutions of Venus into relation to the solar years and
the ceremonial years, or <i>tonalamatl</i>, of 260 days; also to set
forth the relations between the revolutions of the Moon and of
Mercury; further, to divide the year of Venus into four unequal
parts, assigned respectively to the four cardinal points and to
four divinities; and, finally, to designate to which divinities
each of the five Venus-years under consideration should be
dedicated.</p>

<p class='c000'>This illustrates at once the great advance his method has
made in the interpretation of the Codices, and the intimate
relations we find in them between astronomy and mythology.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Such a theory of the Mayan books which we have at hand is
world-wide distant from that of Thomas and Seler. Take, for
example, the series of figures, Cod. Cort., pp. 14<sup>a</sup>, 15<sup>a</sup>, 16<sup>a</sup>.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
Förstemann and myself would consider them to represent the
position of certain celestial bodies before the summer solstice
(indicated by the turtle on p. 7); while Thomas says of them,
“It may safely be assumed that these figures refer to the Maya
process of making bread!!”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>9. <i>Astronomical Knowledge of the Ancient Mayas.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>Our information from European sources as to the astronomical
knowledge possessed by the Mayas is slight.</p>

<p class='c000'>That they looked with especial reverence to the planet Venus
is evident from the various names they applied to it. These
were: <i>Noh Ek</i>, “the Great Star” or “the Right-hand Star;”
<i>Chac Ek</i>, “the Strong Star” (or “the Red Star”); <i>Zaztal Ek</i>,
“the Brilliant Star;” <i>Ah-Zahcab</i>, “the Controller or Companion
of the Dawn;”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a> and <i>Xux Ek</i>, “the Bee or Wasp Star,” for
reasons which will be considered later. In the Tzental dialect
it was called <i>Canan Chulchan</i>, “the Guardian of the Sky,” and
<i>Mucul Canan</i>, “the Great Guardian.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The North Star was well known as <i>Xaman Ek</i> (<i>xaman</i>, north,
<i>ek</i>, star), and also as <i>Chimal Ek</i>, “the Shield Star,” or “Star on
the Shield.”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a> It was spoken of as “the Guide of the Merchants”
(<cite>Dicc. de Motul</cite>), and therefore was probably one of their
special divinities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The historian Landa states that the Mayas measured the passage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of time at night by observations of the Pleiades and Orion.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
The name of the former in their language is <i>Tzab</i>, a word which
also means the rattles of the rattlesnake. In the opinion of Dr.
Förstemann,<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a> their position in the heavens decided the beginning
of the year (or, perhaps, cycle, as with the Nahuas), and they
were represented in the hieroglyphs by the <i>moan</i> sign (to be explained
on a later page).</p>

<p class='c000'>Certain stars of the constellation Gemini were defined, and
named <i>Ac</i>, or <i>Ac Ek</i>, “the Tortoise Stars,” from an imagined
similarity of outline to that of the tortoise.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> This may explain
the not infrequent occurrence of the picture of that animal in
the Codices, and its representations in stone at Copan and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>The terms for a comet in Maya were <i>Budz Ek</i>, “Smoking
Star,” and <i>Ikomne</i>, “Breathing or Blowing,” as it was supposed
to blow forth its fiery train; in Tzental it was <i>Tza Ec</i>, “Star
Dust.” Shooting stars were <i>Chamal Dzutan</i>, “Magicians’
Pipes,” as they were regarded as the fire-tubes of certain powerful
enchanters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stars in Orion were known as <i>Mehen Ek</i>, “the Sons,”
doubtless referring to some astronomical myth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Milky Way was spoken of under two different names,
both of obscure application, <i>Tamacaz</i> and <i>Ah Poou</i>. Another
meaning of the former word is “madness, insanity;” and the
latter term was also applied to a youth who had just attained the
age of puberty.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Perhaps the connection of the word lies in the
ceremonies of initiation practiced by many tribes when a youth
reached this age, and which, by fasting and the administration of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>toxic herbs, often led to temporary mania; and the deity of the
Milky Way may have presided over these rites.</p>

<p class='c000'>The moon in opposition was referred to as <i>u nupptanba</i>, from
<i>nupp</i>, opposed, opposite. When in conjunction, the expression
was <i>hunbalan u</i>, “the rope of the moon,” or, “the moon roped.”
When it was in eclipse, it was <i>chibil u</i>, “the moon bitten,” the
popular story being that it was bitten by a kind of ant called
<i>xulab</i>. An eclipse of the sun was also <i>chibil kin</i>, “the sun bitten;”
but more frequently the phrase was <i>tupul u uich kin</i>, or,
<i>tupan u uich kin</i>, “the eye of the day is covered over,” or,
“shut up.” It is useful to record such expressions, as they
sometimes suggested the graphic representations of the occurrences.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>III. The Pictorial Elements.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To understand the pictorial portions of the inscriptions some
acquaintance with the native mythology is indispensable.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>1. <i>The Religion of the Ancient Mayas.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The religion of the Mayas was a polytheism, but the principal
deities were few in number, as is expressly stated by Father
Francisco Hernandez, the earliest missionary to Yucatan
(1517);<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a> and these, according to the explicit assertion of Father
Lizana, were the same as those worshipped by the Tzentals of
Tabasco and Chiapas.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a> Both these statements are confirmed by
a comparison of the existing remains, and they greatly facilitate
a comprehension of the Codices and epigraphy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spirit of this religion was dualistic, the gods of life and
light, of the sun and day, of birth and food, of the fertilizing
showers and the cultivated fields, being placed in contrast to
those of misfortune and pain, of famine and pestilence, of blight
and night, darkness and death. Back of them all, indeed the
source of them all, was <i>Hunab Ku</i>, “the One Divine;” but of
him no statue and no picture was made, for he was incorporeal
and invisible.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><i>Itzamna.</i>—Chief of the beneficent gods was <i>Itzamna</i>. He was
the personification of the East, the rising sun, with all its manifold
mythical associations. His name means “the dew or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>moisture of the morning,” and he was the spirit of the early
mists and showers. He was said to have come in his magic
skiff from the East, across the waters, and therefore he presided
over that quarter of the world and the days and years assigned
to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>For similar reasons he received the name <i>Lakin chan</i>, “the
Serpent of the East,” under which he seems to have been popularly
known. As light is synonymous with both life and knowledge,
he was said to have been the creator of men, animals, and
plants, and was the founder of the culture of the Mayas. He
was the first priest of their religion, and invented writing and
books; he gave the names to the various localities in Yucatan,
and divided the land among the people; as a physician he was
famous, knowing not only the magic herbs, but possessing the
power of healing by touch, whence his name <i>Kabil</i>, “the skilful
hand,” under which he was worshipped in Chichen Itza. For
his wisdom he was spoken of as <i>Yax coc ah-mut</i>, “the royal or
noble master of knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Cuculcan.</i>—In some sense a contrast, in others a completion
of the mythical concepts embodied in Itzamna, was <i>Cuculcan</i> or
Cocol chan, “the feathered or winged serpent.”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a> He also was a
hero-god, a deity of culture and of kindliness. He was traditionally
the founder of the great cities of Chichen Itza, and
Mayapan; was active in framing laws and introducing the calendar,
at the head of which some Maya tribes placed his name;
was skilled in leechcraft, and was spoken of as the god of chills
and fevers.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Itzamna was identified with the East, so was Cuculcan
with the West. Thence he was said to have come, and thither
returned.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a> In the Tzental calendars he was connected with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>seventh day (<i>moxic</i>, Maya, <i>manik</i>); hence he is mystically associated
with that number. He corresponds to the <i>Gukumatz</i> of
the Quiche mythology, a name which has the same signification.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the myth he is described as clothed in a long robe and
wearing sandals, and, what is noteworthy, <i>having a beard</i>. In
the calendars of the Tzentals he was painted “in the likeness
of a man and a snake,” and the “masters” explained this as
“the snake with feathers, which moves in the waters,” that is,
the heavenly waters, the clouds and the rains; for which reason
Bishop Nuñez de la Vega, to whom we owe this information,
identified him with the Mexican Mixcoatl, “the cloud serpent;”<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a>
whereas Bishop Landa was of opinion that he was the Mexican
Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Kin ich.</i>—As Itzamna was thus connected with the rising,
morning sun, and Cuculcan with the afternoon and setting sun,
so the sun in the meridian was distinguished from both of them.
As a divinity, it bore the name <i>Kin ich</i>, “the eye or face of the
day.” The sacrifices to it were made at the height of noontide,
when it was believed that the deity descended in the shape of
the red macaw (the <i>Ara macao</i>), known as <i>Kak mo</i>, “the bird
of fire,” from the color of its plumage, and consumed the offering.
Such ceremonies were performed especially in times of
great sickness, general mortality, the destruction of the crops
through locusts, and other public calamities. It seems probable
from the accounts that Kin ich was a much less prominent
divinity in the popular mind than either of the other two solar
deities, and his attributes were occasionally assigned to Itzamna,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>as we find the combination <i>Kin ich ahau Itzamna</i> among the
names of divinities.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><i>Other Gods.</i>—To Itzamna was assigned as consort <i>Ix Chel</i>,
“the rainbow,” also known as <i>Ix Kan Leom</i>, “the spider-web”
(which catches the dew of the morning). She was goddess of
medicine and of childbirth, and her children were the <i>Bacabs</i>, or
<i>Chacs</i> (giants),<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a> four mighty brethren, who were the gods of the
four cardinal points, of the winds which blow from them, of the
rains these bring, of the thunder and the lightning, and consequently
of agriculture, the harvests, and the food supply. Their
position in the ritual was of the first importance. To each were
assigned a particular color and a certain year and day in the
calendar. To <i>Hobnil</i>, “the hollow one” or “the belly,” were
given the south, the color yellow, and the day and years <i>kan</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the first of the calendar series, and so on. The red Bacab was
to the east, the white to the north, and the black, whose name
was <i>Hozan Ek</i>, “the Disembowelled,” to the west.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><i>The Cardinal Points.</i>—Much attention has been directed to
these divinities as representing the worship of the cardinal points
and to the colors, days, cycles, and elements mythically associated
with them. Uniform results have not been obtained, as
the authorities differ, as probably did also the customs of various
localities.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a> Pio Perez assigns <i>kan</i> to the east, <i>muluc</i> to the north,
<i>ix</i> to the west, and <i>cauac</i> to the south. The arrangement based
on Landa’s statements would be as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, it should be noted that the names of the
winds in Maya distinctly assign the color white to the east,
thus:—</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>East wind,</td>
    <td class='c017'><i>zac ik</i>, “white wind.”</td>

    <td class='c016'>Southeast wind,</td>
    <td class='c017'><i>zac nohol ik</i>, “white south wind.”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>The solution of these difficulties must be left for future investigation.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>The Good Gods.</i>—Divinities of a beneficent character were
<i>Yum Chac</i>, “Lord of Waters or Rains;” <i>Yum Kaax</i>, “Lord of
the Harvest Fields;” <i>Cum Ahau</i>, “Lord of the Vase,” that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of the rains, who is described in the Dic. Motul as “Lucifer,
Chief of the Devils” and is probably a name of Itzamna; <i>Zuhuy
Kak</i>, “Virgin Fire,” patroness of infants; <i>Zuhuy Dzip</i>, “The
Virgin of Dressed Animals,” a hunting goddess; <i>Ix Tabai</i>,
“Goddess of the Ropes or Snares,” also a hunting goddess as
well as the patroness of those who hanged themselves; <i>Ah Kak
Nech</i>, “He Who Looks after the Cooking Fire,” <i>Ah Ppua</i>, “the
Master of Dew,” and <i>Ah Dziz</i>, “The Master of Cold,” divinities
of the fishermen.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this list should be added <i>Acan</i>, “the God of the Intoxicating
Mead,” the national beverage, that being its name; <i>Ek
Chua</i>, “the Black Companion,” god of the cacao planters and
the merchants, as these used the cacao beans as a medium of
exchange; <i>Ix Tub Tun</i>, “she who spits out Precious Stones,”
goddess of the workers in jade and amethysts; <i>Cit Bolon Tun</i>,
“the Nine (<i>i. e.</i>, numberless) Precious Stones,” a god of medicine;
<i>Xoc Bitum</i>, the God of Singing, and <i>Ah Kin Xoc</i> or <i>Ppiz
Lim Tec</i>, the God of Poetry (<i>xoc</i>, to sing or recite); <i>Ix Chebel
Yax</i>, the first inventress of painting and of colored designs on
woven stuffs (<i>chebel</i>, to paint, and a paint-brush).</p>

<p class='c000'>A minor deity was <i>Tel Cuzaan</i>, “the swallow-legged,” a divinity
of the island of Cozumel (“Swallow Island”).</p>

<p class='c000'>On a lofty pyramid, where is now the city of Valladolid, Yucatan,
was worshipped <i>Ah zakik ual</i>, “Lord of the East Wind.”
His idol was of pottery in the shape of a vase, moulded in front
into an ugly face. In it they burned copal and other gums.
His festival was celebrated every fourth year with sham battles.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
Probably this was a representation of Itzamna as lord of the
cardinal point.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Island of Women,” Isla de Mugeres, on the east coast,
was so named because the first explorers found there the statues
of four female divinities, to whom altars and temples were dedicated.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>They were <i>Ix-chel</i>, <i>Ix-chebel-yax</i>, <i>Ix-hun-yé</i>, and <i>Ix-hun-yeta</i>.
The first two have already been mentioned. The
last two seem to have been goddesses connected with the moonrise
and sunrise, as the dictionaries give as the meaning of <i>yé</i>,
“to show one’s self, to appear;” as in the phrases <i>yethaz y ahalcab</i>,
“at the appearance of the dawn;” <i>yethaz u hokol u</i>, “at
moonrise;” <i>yet hokol kin</i>, “at sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Prominent among mythical beings were the dwarfs, known
as <i>ppuz</i>, “bent over;” <i>ac uinic</i>, “turtle men;” <i>tzapa uinic</i>,
“shortened men;” and <i>pputum</i>, “small of body.” They are
sometimes represented in the carvings, an interesting example
being in the Peabody Museum. A legend concerning such
brownies was that before the last destruction of the world the
whole human race degenerated into like diminutive beings,
which prompted the gods to destroy it.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a> One class of these
little creatures, called <i>acat</i>, were said to become transformed into
flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I have shown elsewhere,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a> many similar superstitions survive
in the folk-lore of Yucatan and Tabasco to-day. But it is
not safe to look at such survivals as part of genuine ancient mythology.
For instance, the goddess <i>Ix-nuc</i>, or <i>Xnuc</i>, said by
Brasseur to have been goddess of the mountains, by Seler, goddess
of the earth, and by Schellhas, goddess of water, is in fact
not a member of the Maya Pantheon. The name means simply
“old woman,” and was first mentioned by an anonymous
modern writer in the <cite><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Registro Yucateco</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>The Gods of Evil.</i>—In contrast to the beneficent deities were
those who presided over war, disease, death, and the underworld.
Distinctively war gods were <i>Uac Lom Chaam</i>, “He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>whose teeth are six lances,” worshipped anciently at Ti-ho, the
present Mérida; <i>Ahulane</i>, “The Archer,” painted holding an
arrow, whose shrine was on the island of Cozumel; <i>Pakoc</i> (from
<i>paakal</i>, to frighten) and <i>Hex Chun Chan</i>, “The dangerous one,”
divinities of the Itzaes; <i>Kak u pacat</i>, “Fire (is) his face,” who
is said to have carried in battle a shield of fire; <i>Ah Chuy Kak</i>,
“He who works in fire,” that is, for destruction; <i>Ah Cun Can</i>,
“The serpent charmer,” also worshipped at Ti-Ho; <i>Hun Pic Tok</i>,
“He of 8000 lances,” who had a temple at Chichen Itza.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chief of all these evil beings was the God of Death. His
name is preserved in the first account we have of Yucatecan
mythology, that by Father Hernandez, and, according to Father
Lara, it was the same among the Tzentals, Maya, <i>Ah-puch</i>,
Tzental, <i>Pucugh</i>. These words mean “the Undoer,” or
“Spoiler,” apparently a euphemism to avoid pronouncing a
name of evil omen.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a> In modern Maya he is plain <i>Yum cimil</i>,
“lord of death.” He was painted as a skeleton with bare skull,
and was then called <i>Chamay Bac</i>, or <i>Zac Chamay Bac</i>, “white
teeth and bones.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The spirit (<i>pixan</i>) after death was supposed to go to the
Underworld, which was called <i>Mitna</i>, or <i>Metna</i> where presided
the god <i>Xibilba</i> or <i>Xabalba</i>, sometimes called <i>Hun Ahau</i>, “the
One lord,” for to his realm must all come at last.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a> Another
name for this Hades was <i>tancucula</i> (perhaps <i>tan kukul</i>, “before
the gods,” <i>i. e.</i>, where one is judged), which is given by the
<cite>Dicc. Motul</cite> as an “ancient word” (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">vocablo antiguo</span>). The
happy souls then passed to a realm of joy, where they spent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>their time under the great green tree <i>Yaxche</i>, while those who
were condemned sank down to a place of cold and hunger.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>The Conflict of the Gods.</i>—Between these two classes of deities—those
who make for good and those who make for evil in the
life of man—there is, both in the myths and in the picture
writings, an eternal conflict.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the Codex Troano, as Dr. Seler remarks, “The god of
death appears as the inevitable foil of the god of light and
heaven. In whatever action the latter is depicted, the god of
death is imitating it, but in such a manner that with him all turns
to nought and emptiness. Where the light-god holds the string,
in the hands of the death-god it is torn asunder; where the
former offers incense, the latter carries the sign of ‘fire’ wherewith
to consume it; where the former presents the sign <i>kan</i>,

  <h3 class='c012'>2. <i>The Cosmogony of the Mayas.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We know practically nothing of the cosmogony of the Mayas;
but it is instructive in connection with their calendar system to
find that, like the Nahuas, they believed in Epochs of the Universe,
at the close of each of which there was a general destruction
of both gods and men. The early writer, Aguilar, says
that he learned from the native books themselves that they
recorded three such periodical cataclysms. The first was called
<i>Mayacimil</i>, “general death;” the second, <i>Oc na kuchil</i>, “the
ravens enter the houses,” that is, the inhabitants were all dead;
and the third, <i>Hun yecil</i>, a universal deluge, a term which the
<cite>Dicc. Motul</cite> seems to explain by mentioning a tradition that the
water was so high “that its surface was within the distance of
one stalk of maguey from the sky!” Another term for this
catastrophe was <i>bulcabal</i>, <i>haycabal</i> or <i>haycabil</i> (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">destruccion, asolamiento
y diluvio general con que fué destruido y asolado el
mundo</span>. <cite>Dicc. Motul</cite>).</p>

<p class='c000'>This would make the present the fourth age of the world (not
the fifth, as the Nahuas believed); and this corresponds to the
prophecies contained in the “Books of Chilan Balam,” which I
have quoted in another work. The scene of the creation of man,
the “terrestrial Paradise,” was known as <i>hun anhil</i>, and the name
of the first man was <i>Anum</i>, both apparently from the verb <i>anhel</i>,
to stand erect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the high calculations of the priests must have been
for the purpose of discovering the length of the present epoch
and how soon the world would end. They seem to have
thought this would take place when all their various time-measures
would merge together into a common unity, which each
could divide without remainder.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 class='c012'>3. <i>Cosmical Conceptions of the Mayas.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The cosmical conceptions of the ancient Mayas have not
hitherto been understood; but by a study of existing documents
I believe they can be correctly explained in outline.</p>

<div id='fig_9'  class='figcenter id007'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 9.</span>—The Universe. (From the Chilan Balam of Mani.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>One of these is the central design in the Chilan Balam, or
Sacred Book, of Mani (Fig. <a href='#fig_9'>9</a>). It was copied by Father Cogolludo
in 1640, and inserted in his History of Yucatan, with a
totally false interpretation which the natives designedly gave
him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The lettering in the above figure is by the late Dr. C. H.
Berendt, and was obtained by him from other books of Chilan
Balam, and native sources. In Cogolludo’s work, this design is
surrounded by thirteen heads which signify the thirteen <i>ahau
katuns</i>, or greater cycles of years, as I have explained elsewhere.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
The number thirteen in American mythology symbolizes the
thirteen possible directions of space.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a> The border, therefore,
expresses the totality of Space and Time; and the design itself
symbolizes Life within Space and Time. This is shown as follows:
At the bottom of the field lies a cubical block, which represents
the earth, always conceived of this shape in Mayan
mythology.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a> It bears, however, not the lettering, <i>lum</i>, the Earth,
as we might expect, but, significantly, <i>tem</i>, the Altar. The Earth
is the great altar of the Gods, and the offering upon it is Life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Above the earth-cube, supported on four legs which rest upon
the four quarters of the mundane plane, is the celestial vase,
<i>cum</i>, which contains the heavenly waters, the rains and showers,
on which depends the life of vegetation, and therefore that of
the animal world as well. Above it hang the heavy rain clouds,
<i>muyal</i>, ready to fill it; within it grows the <i>yax che</i>, the Tree of
Life, spreading its branches far upward, on their extremities
the flowers or fruit of life, the soul or immortal principle of man,
called <i>ol</i> or <i>yol</i>.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Turning now to the central design of what has been called
the “Tableau of the Bacabs,” in the Codex Cortesianus, Fig. <a href='#fig_10'>10</a>,
we can readily see in the light of the above explanation that its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>lesson is the same. The design is surrounded by the signs of
the twenty days, beyond which the field (not shown in this cut)
is apportioned to the four cardinal points and the deities and
time-cycles connected with them.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 10.</span>—Our First Parents. (From the Cortesian Codex.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Again it is Life within Space and Time which the artist presents.
The earth is not represented; but we readily recognize
in conventionalized form the great Tree of Life, across it the
celestial Vase, and above it the cloud-masses. On the right sits
Cuculcan, on the left Xmucane, the divine pair called in the
<cite>Popol Vuh</cite> “the Creator and the Former, Grandfather and Grandmother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>of the race, who give Life, who give Reproduction.”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a>
In his right hand Cuculcan holds three glyphs, each containing
the sign of Life, <i>ik</i>. Xmucane has before her one with the sign
of union (sexual); above it, one containing the life-sign (product
of union); and these are surmounted by the head of a
fish, symbolizing the fructifying and motherly waters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The total extension of the field in these designs resembles
the glyph <i>a</i> in Fig. <a href='#fig_6'>6</a>. It is found in both Mayan and Mexican
MSS.,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a> and expresses the conception these peoples had of the
Universe. Hence I give it the name of the “cosmic sign.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>4. <i>Pictorial Representations of Divinities.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>Turning to the Codices and the monuments with the above
mythological lore in one’s memory, it seems to me there is no
difficulty in identifying most of the pictures presented by them.
That this has not been accomplished heretofore, I attribute to
the neglect of the myths by previous writers, and a persistent
desire to discover in the mythology of the Mayas, not the divinities
which they themselves worshipped, but those of some other
nation, as the Nahuas, Quiches, Zapotecs, or Pueblo dwellers.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c014'><sup>[66]</sup></a>
I shall pay small attention to such analogies, as the Mayas had
a religion of their own, and it is that which I wish to define.
We may turn first to the—</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 11.</span>—Monogram of Itzamna.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><i>Representations of Itzamna.</i>—I have no hesitation in identifying
Itzamna with the “god B,” as catalogued
by Dr. Schellhas in his excellent study of the
divinities of the Codices,<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c014'><sup>[67]</sup></a> and which he believes
to be Cuculcan, while the Abbé Brasseur,
followed by Dr. Seler, argue, that it is a
“Tlaloc” or Chac, <i>i. e.</i>, a rain god.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a> He is
extremely prominent in the Codices, being
painted in the Dresden Codex alone not less than 130 times, and
in the others about 70 times. No other deity has half so many
representations, and we may well believe, therefore, that he was
the Jove of their Pantheon.</p>

<p class='c000'>This at once suggests Itzamna; but a phrase of the historian
Cogolludo leaves no doubt about it. The “god B” is associated
with the signs of the east, and his especial and invariable
characteristic are two long, serpent-like teeth, which project from
his mouth, one in front, the other to the side and backward.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a>
These traits enable us to identify “B” with Lakin Chan, “the
serpent of the east,” who was portrayed “with strangely deformed
teeth,” and this was unquestionably but another name
for Itzamna, the god of the east.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c014'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 13.</span>—Itzamna: from the Inscription of Kabah.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>An abundance of evidence may be adduced to confirm
this opinion. This deity is represented in close relations
with the serpent, holding it in his hand, sitting upon it,
even swallowed by it, or emerging from its throat. As a
“medicine man” he carries the “medicine bag,” and the wand
or baton, called in Maya <i>caluac</i>, “the perforated stick,”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c014'><sup>[71]</sup></a> surmounted
with a hand, hinting at his name above given, <i>Kabil</i>,
the Skilful Hand. He is often in a boat, to recall his advent
over the eastern sea, and he is frequently associated with the
showers, as was Itzamna, who said of himself, <i>itz en muyal, itz
en caan</i>, “I am what trickles from the clouds, from the sky.”
As the rising sun which dispels the darkness, or else as the
physician who heals disease, he is portrayed sitting on the head
of the owl, the bird of night and sickness; and as the giver of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>life he is associated with the emblem of the snail, typical of
birth.</p>

<p class='c000'>He himself is never connected with the symbols of death or
misfortune, but always with those of life and light. The lance
and tomahawk which he often carries are to drive away the
spirits of evil.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the above peculiarities, he is portrayed as an elderly
man, his nose is long and curved downward, his eye is always
the “ornamented eye,” which in the Maya Codices indicates a
divinity. He is associated with all four quarters of the globe,
for the East defines the cardinal points; and what is especially
interesting, it is he who is connected with the Maya “Tree of
Life,” the celebrated symbol of the cross, found on so many
ancient monuments of this people and which has excited so
much comment. This I shall consider later.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 15.</span>—Mask of Itzamna (?).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We know from the mythology that Itzamna, like most deities,
was multiform, appearing in various incarnations. In the ceremonies
this was represented by masks; with this in mind I class
as merely one of the forms or epiphanies of Itzamna that figure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>in the Codices described by Dr. Schellhas as a separate deity,
“the god with the ornamental nose,” whom he catalogues as
“god K.” I am led to this conclusion by a careful study of all
the pictographs in which this deity
appears; they all seem to show
that it is Itzamna wearing a mask
to indicate some one manifestation
of his power (see especially
Cod. Dresden., pp. 7, 12, 25, 26,
and 34, 65, and 67, where Itzamna
is carrying the mask on his head). That there is a particular
monogram for this character merely indicates that it was a
separate mythological manifestation, not a different deity.</p>

<p class='c000'>A remarkable and constant feature in the representations of
Itzamna is his <i>nose</i>. Thomas calls it “elephantine,” but, as
Waldeck and Seler have shown, it is undoubtedly intended to
imitate the snout of the <i>tapir</i>.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When we remember that this animal was sacred to Votan,
who played the same part in Chiapas that Itzamna did in Yucatan,
dividing and naming the land, etc.; and that the interesting
slate tablets from Chiapas, in the National Museum of Mexico,
portray the sacred tapir in intimate connection with the symbol
of <i>the hand</i>,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a> that associated with Itzamna,—we are led to identify
the two mythical personages as one and the same. According
to Bishop Landa the tapir was not found in Yucatan except on
the western shore near the bay of Campeche,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a> which shows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>that the myth of the tapir god was imported from Tzental
territory.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be asked why the tapir, a dull animal, loving swamps
and dark recesses of the forests, should have been chosen to
represent a divinity of light. I reply, that it arose from the
“ikonomatic” method of writing. The word for tapir in Maya
is <i>tzimin</i>, in Tzental <i>tzemen</i>, and from the similarity of this sound
to <i>i-tzam-na</i> the animal came to be selected as his symbol. No
such sacredness attached to the brute among the Quiches, for
in their tongue the allusive sound did not exist, the tapir being
called <i>tixl</i>. This rebus also confirms the identity of Itzamna
with the tapir-nosed deity of the Codices.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The annual festival to Itzamna was called <i>Pocam</i>, “the cleansing.”
On that occasion the priests, arrayed in all their insignia,
assembled in the house of their prince. First, they invoked
Itzamna as the founder of their order and burned to him incense
with fire newly made from the friction of sticks. Next they
spread out upon a table covered with green leaves the sacred
books, and asperged their pages with water drawn from a spring
of which no woman had ever tasted. This was the ceremonial
“cleansing.” Then the chief priest arose and declared the
prognostics for the coming year as written in the holy records.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We may well believe that the Dresden Codex, pages 29–43,
which are entirely taken up with the deeds and ceremonies of Itzamna,
was one of the books spread out on this solemn occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Representations of Cuculcan.</i>—As I believe the reasons above
given are sufficient to establish the identity of the “god B,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>of Dr. Schellhas’ catalogue, with Itzamna, so I think his “god D”
is Cuculcan.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a> He himself believes it to be a “night god,” or
a “moon god,” while Dr. Seler considers it to portray Itzamna.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 17.</span>—Cuculcan, with owl head-dress.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The characteristics of this divinity are: A face of an old
man, with sunken mouth and toothless jaws, except one tooth
in the lower jaw, which, in the Tro. and Cortes. Codices, is
exaggerated as a distinctive sign; he has the “ornamented
eye” peculiar to deities; and to his forehead is attached, or
over it hangs, an affix, which generally bears the sign <i>akbal</i>,
which means “darkness,” because he is the setting or night
sun; for which reason his head-dress is often the horns of the
eared owl. He is clearly a beneficent deity, and is never associated
with symbols of misfortune or death. Indeed, he is at
times evidently a god of birth, being accompanied with the
symbol of the snail, above explained, and is sometimes associated
with women apparently as an obstetrician. He is connected
with serpent emblems, and holds in his hand a sacred
rattle formed of the rattles of the rattlesnake.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these traits coincide with the myths of Cuculcan; but
when we perceive that he, and he alone of all the deities, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>occasionally depicted <i>with a beard under his chin</i>, just as Cuculcan
wore in the legend, the identification becomes complete.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The most striking of his representations, and that which is
most distinctive of his identity with the “green-feathered serpent,”
is the picture which extends over pp. 4 and 5, middle, of
the Dresden Codex. Here he is seen with face emerging from the
mouth of the great, green-feathered snake-dragon, indicative of
his own personality, his hieroglyph immediately above his head.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c014'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><i>Representations of Kin ich.</i>—As has already been observed, the
sun at noon, conceived as a divinity, did not occupy a prominent
place in Maya mythology; and this is also the case in the
pictorial designs.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 18.</span>—Monogram of Kin ich.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is no doubt as to his representation. It
is accompanied by the well-known ideogram of
the sun scattered over his body and represented
above him. It will be seen on a later page.</p>

<p class='c000'>He is richly arrayed with large ear-rings and a
characteristic, prominent nose decoration. He
has the “ornamented eye” and a full head dress.
(God “G” of Schellhas.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Proceeding now to consider other divinities of the beneficent
class, I begin with—</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Representations of Xaman Ek, the Pole Star.</i>—This is the “god
C, of the ornamented face,” of Dr. Schellhas’ list, who suggests
its identity with the pole star. The very characteristic face recurs
extremely frequently, especially in Codices Troano, Cortesianus,
and Peresianus. We have evidently to do with an
important divinity, and, as Dr. Schellhas says, “one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>most remarkable and difficult figures in the manuscripts.”
That it is the personification of a star he argues, (1) from the
ring of rays with which it is surrounded, Cod. Cort., p. 10;
(2) from its appearance in the “constellation band;” (3) from its
surmounting in certain pictures the “tree of life;” and that it
is the North Star is shown by its presence in the hieroglyph
of that quarter and its association with the sign for north.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is another, and, to me, decisive argument, which at once
confirms Dr. Schellhas’ opinion, and explains why the north
star is represented by this peculiar, decorated face.</p>

<p class='c000'>The term for “north” in Maya is <i>xaman</i>, whence <i>xaman ek</i>,
north star. The only other word in the language which at all
resembles this is <i>xamach</i>, the flat, decorated plate or dish (Nahuatl,
<i>comalli</i>) on which tortillas, etc., are served. In the rebus-writing
the decorations on the rim of this dish were conventionally
transferred to the face of the deity, so as to distinguish it by
recalling the familiar utensil. For a similar reason it is also
called “the shield star,” <i>chimal ek</i> (like <i>chimal ik</i>, north wind);
but as this is a foreign word (from the Nahuatl, <i>chimalli</i>, shield),
it was doubtless later and local. I shall refer to this peculiar
edging or border as the “pottery decoration,” and we shall
find it elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the figure is associated at times with all four quarters of
the world, and also with the supreme number 13 (see above,
p. <a href='#Page_24'>24</a>), are not at all against the identification, as Dr. Schellhas
seems to think, but in favor of it; for at night, all four directions
are recognized by the position of the pole; and its immovable
relation to the other celestial bodies seems to indicate that
it belongs above the highest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The North Star is especially spoken of as “the guide of
merchants.” Its representation is associated with symbols of
peace and plenty (removing the contents of a tall vase, C. Cortes.,
p. 40; seated under a canopy, ibid., p. 29). In front of his
forehead is attached a small vase, the contents of which are
trickling into his mouth (?).</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 19.</span>—The North Star God.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He is especially prominent in the earlier pages of the Cod.
Peres., where his presence seems to have been practically overlooked
by previous writers; and it is true that the drawings are
nearly erased. Close inspection will show, however, that he is
portrayed on both sides of the long column of figures which
runs up the middle of page 3. On the left, he is seated on the
“Tree of Life,” as in Cod. Troanus, p. 17, <i>a</i> (which is growing
from the vase of the rains, precisely as in Cod. Tro., 14, <i>b</i>,
where the star-god is sailing in the vase itself).
On the right of the column he is shown in the
darkness of night (on a black background),
holding in his hand the <i>kan</i> symbol of fortune
and food. A similar contrast is on page 7,
where on the right of the column he is seen
above the fish, and on the left, in the dark,
again with the <i>kan</i> symbol. On the intermediate
page he is seated opposite the figure of Kin ich
Ahau, which is head downward, signifying that
when the sun is absent the pole star rules the sky.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 20.</span>—The Bee god. (Codex Troano.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><i>Representations of the Planet Venus.</i>—In view of the prominent
part which the Venus-year plays in the calculations of the
Codices, it has surprised students that
no pictorial figures of this bright star
appear on their pages. On this point
I have some suggestions to make.</p>

<p class='c000'>In one part of the Codex Troano
(pp. 1*–10*) there are a great many—nearly
fifty—pictures of an insect resembling
a bee in descending flight.
These pages have been explained by
Thomas as relating to apiculture and
the festivals of the bee-keepers, and by Seler, who rejects that
rendering, as referring generally to the descent of deities to
receive offerings. Direction downward is indicated not only
by the position of the insect, but by the accompanying hieroglyph,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>which reads <i>caban</i>, the first syllable of which, <i>cab</i>, means
“downward.” My suggestion is that in this bee-like insect we
have an ikonomatic allusion to the Evening Star, which, as I
have already stated, was sometimes called <i>xux ek</i>, “the bee or
wasp star.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c014'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Not only is the picture phonetically appropriate, and the
“sign” consistent, but that a deity is referred to is shown by
three anthropomorphic pictures of the bee (two on p. 4* and one
on p. 5*). Furthermore, the “sign” or monogram of the bee
deity (Fig. <a href='#fig_20'>20</a>) appears on the so-called “title pages” of the
Cod. Tro. and Cod. Cortes., adjacent to that of the north star,
indicating that another stellar deity is represented.</p>

<p class='c000'>The object toward which the insect descends is generally either
a fire, or that shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_22'>22</a>.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a> This was supposed by Brasseur
to be a honeycomb, and by Seler, a food offering. It is
almost precisely the conventional representation of the clouds,
as may be noted in the interesting scene on Cod. Tro., p. 5*, where
this object is placed upon the earth, below which is the cloud
symbol. Often it is yellowish, a point which has been urged in
proof that it is honey. Does it not mean the golden-hued clouds
of sunset, and the fire, the flame of the setting sun, into which
the Evening Star descends?</p>

<p class='c000'>The sign <i>caban</i>, “downward,” naturally refers to the Earth.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a>
Thither sinks the star of evening to join the departed orb of
day; hence this star mythically becomes the Earth-goddess,
the associate of the setting sun. Cuculcan is very frequently
depicted in relation to an old crone, having, like himself, but one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>tooth, and, like himself, ever engaged in kindly offices, good to
men. She, I take it, is the Evening Star in her epiphany as
Mother Earth, source of life, ancestress of the race.</p>

<p class='c000'>A striking verbal analogy supports this. In the Popol Vuh,
the sacred book of the Quiches, the “feathered serpent,” Gukumatz,
is positively said to be the bisexual principle of life represented
by the male Xpiyacoc and the female Xmucane, ancestor
and ancestress of all that is.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a> Here, <i>x-mucane</i> is most likely the
Quiche feminine form of <i>muc</i> (<i>ul</i>) <i>canan</i>, which is a Tzental name
for the planet Venus, as I have already mentioned.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a> My conclusion
is, therefore, that the old woman so
frequently associated with Cuculcan is the
Evening Star, in her form as the Earth-Goddess.
I shall recur to her on a later page.</p>

<p class='c000'>I think all these representations of the bee
should be interpreted as indicating the movements
of Venus, and the mythical conceptions
with which they were connected in the native mind.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span><i>Representation of Ghanan, God of Growth and Fertility.</i>—Bishop
Nuñez de la Vega tells us that in the calendar he discovered
among the natives of his diocese, the fourth “sign” or day
corresponded to the Mexican Centeotl, god of fertility and the
maize harvests. This fourth day in the Tzental calendar bore
the name <i>Ghanan</i>, and on turning to the Tzental Dictionary
prepared by Father Lara, we find that <i>ghan</i> is the general term
for the ear of maize; <i>aghan</i>, when the grains are still soft.</p>

<p class='c000'>His representations in the Codices are moderately frequent
and quite peculiar. They all present in a marked degree the
flattening of the forehead and prolongation of the occiput upward
which is so striking in many of the sculptures.</p>

<div id='fig_23'  class='figleft id019'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 23.</span>—From the Head-dress of the God of Growth.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Schellhas, indeed (who catalogues him as “God E”), is
so impressed by this that he argues that all such forms were
imaginary, obtained by the artists through copying the conventional
drawings of an ear of maize arranged as a head-dress.
This, however, is going too far, as there is evidence,
derived from ancient skulls, that certain
classes of Maya priests used to have the head
artificially flattened in this manner.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c014'><sup>[85]</sup></a> Perhaps
they were those destined for the service of this
or similar deities. The officiants on the Palenque
“Tablet of the Cross,” presenting offerings
to the “tree of life,” are both deformed in this
manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The maize god is associated with symbols of
food, of vegetable growth, and of prosperity.
He carries a vase or is drawing forth the contents
of one, Cod. Cort., p. 40; he is seen with
the loom, Cod. Dres., p. 45, and he generally
has about him the <i>kan</i> symbol, that of means
and comfort.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span><i>Representations of the Serpent Goddess.</i>—One of the most striking
pictures in the Codices is the Serpent Goddess, whose familiar
is the rattlesnake, which she wears as a head-dress or as a
girdle. She is depicted as an old woman, her costume ample
and often splendid, decorated with embroidery and bells, with
necklace and ear-rings of jade.</p>

<p class='c000'>In expression she is severe, her lips protrude in anger, and
her hands and feet sometimes end in claws. The sinister cross-bones
sometimes decorate her skirts. Her business is with
water and the rains. She is pouring from a vase (<cite>Cod. Dres.</cite>, pp.
43, 67, 74); or water is flowing from her armpits, hands, and
mammæ; or she is ejecting it forcibly from her mouth (<cite>Cod.
Tro.</cite>, pp. 25, 27, 34*).</p>

<p class='c000'>She is, however, not always represented as in old age, or else
there was another serpent goddess in the mythology; for in a
number of places a similar serpentine head-dress is borne by a
young woman who holds a vase containing the rattles of the
rattlesnake (<cite>Cod. Dres.</cite>, pp. 15, 18); or (ibid., p. 20), a figure which
shows seven black dots. May this be a sign of the constellation
of the Pleiades, which in the Maya language bore the same
name as the rattles of the rattlesnake, <i>tzab</i>?</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the signification of the serpent goddess, I think there
can be no question of it, from a study of her appearance, signs,
and associations. She was the <i>personification of the thunderstorm</i>.
The vase she empties is the descending torrent of rain,
the rattles she carries are the thunderclaps, her severe mien is
the terror inspired by the din of the elements. In Maya, the
word for “thunder,” <i>pecchac</i>, is derived from the noun <i>pec</i>, which
means “a sound like that of a bell or rattle” (<cite>Dicc. Motul</cite>).</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Representations of Xmucane.</i>—A third goddess who can be
clearly distinguished is one with features of an old woman, her
face wrinkled, her mouth sunken, and but one tooth left in her
lower jaw. She usually wears her hair in a peculiar style, two
wisps or ends of it twisted above her head.</p>

<p class='c000'>She does not appear in the Peresianus, and perhaps not in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Dresden manuscript, but holds a prominent place in the Troanus
and Cortesianus. Her occupations are peaceable; she is weaving
on a loom (C. Tro., p. 11), carrying a plate of cakes, etc.
(Cod. Cortes., pp. 10, 11).</p>

<p class='c000'>In appearance she is the female counterpart of Cuculcan,
and is plainly intended to represent his companion or wife. In
the “Tableau des Bacabs” of the Codex Cortes., these two
alone are represented sitting under the central “tree of life,”
where they are placed back to back (see above, p. 49); while in
the section of the tableau showing the West, they are placed
face to face, she seated under a canopy hung with black and red
dotted lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>In her, therefore, we have a person of great importance, the
consort of Cuculcan, intimately associated with the quarter of
the West to which he belongs. Dr. Seler has argued that she
was the goddess Ix chel, and the personification of the Earth.
With the last supposition I agree, but not with the name.
Ix chel was distinctly by name and myth the goddess of the rainbow.
Much more probably we have in this ancient crone, as I
have already said, the personification of the Evening Star, and
the Earth, Xmucane, the companion of the sun when worn
out by his day’s work, whose home is with him in the West, and
whom she soon joins.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Representation of Ah-Puch, God of Death.</i>—Next to Itzamna,
god of Life, the god of Death, Ah-Puch, is represented most
frequently on both Codices and monuments. In the former his
picture is given about eighty times, usually as a skeleton with
tremendous jaws, always with fleshless skull and backbone,—a
true “God Barebones,” as the <cite>Dicc. de Motul</cite> describes
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>His symbols are unmistakeable,—the head of a corpse and
cross-bones, the ill-omened owl and the ravenous dog,—wonderfully
“European” indeed. He has numerous costumes and
head dresses, some quite fanciful, and occasionally bells are attached
to his ankles and clothing. Some of his delineations seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>to reveal a sense of ghastly humor, as we see in the medieval
“dance of death.”</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 24.</span>—The God of Death. (From the Codices.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He is associated with the north, because in that direction lay
the mythical home of departed souls; but he is also present
in the other quarters of the compass, for death knows no distinction
of places or persons. Besides the cross-bones, usually
shown as in Fig. <a href='#fig_25'>25</a>, No. 1, he often bears the curious design No.
2,<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c014'><sup>[86]</sup></a> which I take to be <i>a maggot</i>, and his head-dress is sometimes
as No. 3, decorated with teeth, or flints, with rays.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 26.</span>—The God of War.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><i>Representation of the God of War.</i>—Frequently associated
with the figure of death is that of a deity with a black line
across his face. This is numbered by Dr. Schellhas the “god F,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>and called by him a “god of death.” Much has been made of
the line across his face as identifying him with the Mexican god
Xipe, “the flayer;” but this is not a constant mark of Xipe, as
Father Duran neither mentions it nor portrays it. In fact, it is
nothing more than the line of black paint athwart the face which
meant “war” very generally among the
American Indians. An inspection of
the pictures clearly indicates that this is
a war god. For instance, in Cod. Tr.,
27*, 28*, 29* <i>c</i>, he is shown repeatedly
at full length, armed with a flaming
torch in one hand and a flint knife in the
other, firing the canopies of princes, his
body striped with war-paint like his
face, following the god of death, who
goes before him beating on a drum and
singing a song of war (as shown by the
lines issuing from his mouth). In Cod.
Dresden., p. 6 <i>e</i>, he wears a war helmet with nose-piece, and his
body is black-striped also.</p>

<p class='c000'>Which of the gods of war I have named this leading one may
have been, I leave undetermined.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Representations of Ek Ahau and Other Black Gods.</i>—In the
Codices there are about fifty figures painted black, evidently
intended to represent deities supposed to be thus colored.
Forty of them are in the Codex Troano, which is in parts devoted
to a prominent character of this hue. He is depicted with a
truculent expression, a reddish-brown band around his mouth,
and with a large, hanging under-lip. He is generally armed
and often fighting. His figure is sometimes drawn unusually
large, of a ferocious appearance, and carrying a huge spear,
a shield, a tomahawk, a lighted torch, or other fearful sign of
war. (See Cod. Tro., pp. 24, 25.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Previous writers have not been able to assign a name to
this deity. Prof. Thomas suggested that it was Ek Chuah, said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>by Landa to be the god of the cacao planters; but to this,
Schellhas objects that his warlike traits exclude such a supposition.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c014'><sup>[87]</sup></a>
So the latter refers to him merely as “the god
M.”</p>

<img src='images/illus-067.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 27.</span>—Ek Ahau, the Black Captain.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>About his name, however, there can
be no doubt. The paintings correspond
precisely with what Nuñez de la Vega
tells us of the Tzental divinity <i>Ical
Ahau</i>, Maya, <i>Ek Ahau</i>, names which he
translates, “the black chief,” or, “the
king of the blacks.” He was reported
to have been “a famous warrior and
most cruel.” He was depicted “in the
figure of a ferocious blackamoor with
the members of a man.”<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c014'><sup>[88]</sup></a> The “blacks”
of whom he was king were seven in
number, and were painted in most of the
native calendars which the bishop found
among the Tzentals. They were the
signs of seven days, beginning, he adds,
with Friday, which may have been an erroneous explanation of
the “masters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the remainder of the seven were doubtless the god
<i>Ek Chuah</i>, of the cacao planters, and the god “L” of Dr. Schellhas’
list. The latter is found in the Cod. Dresden., pp. 7, 14, 21,
24, 46; but not at all in the Troanus. It is evident, however,
that, as Dr. Schellhas observes, several minor black gods are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>depicted, which is explained by the statement of the Bishop of
Chiapas, that there were seven of them.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c014'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>5. <i>The Maya Priesthood.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>Not all the designs of the inscriptions and Codices are to be
considered deities, however. Doubtless the priests, their representatives,
also appear. These were numerous and of both sexes,
called respectively, <i>ah-kin</i> and <i>ix-kin</i>, masters of days and mistresses
of days, that is, having power to predict auspicious and
inauspicious days. The chief priest was variously called <i>ah-kin
mai</i> and <i>ahau can mai</i>, the word <i>mai</i>, dust, fragrance, vapor,
referring to the sacred rite of blowing substances through a
tube in incantation, as we find often represented in the Codices.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c014'><sup>[90]</sup></a>
<i>Ahau can</i>, which at times means “rattlesnake,” should perhaps
here be translated, “master of words,” as another term for the
high priest was <i>ah-chun can</i>, which is rendered “one who has
the right of the first speech in business; also, high priest.”
(<cite>Dicc. Motul.</cite>)</p>

<p class='c000'>They were divided into a number of classes exercising special
functions; as the <i>ah-mac ik</i>, who conjured the winds; the
<i>ah-uai chac</i>, who could bring rains; the <i>ah-pul</i>, “fetchers,” who
could cause sickness, induce sleep, etc.; the <i>ah-uai xibalba</i>, who
made a specialty of interviewing departed spirits; the <i>ah-cunal
than</i>, who conjured by magical words; and others.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c014'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 28.</span>—A Maya Priestess, bearing the <i>Moan</i> Bird. (From the Dresden Codex.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In their rites they were accustomed to appear in masks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span><i>koh</i>, and dressed in skins of wild animals, as tigers, etc.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c014'><sup>[92]</sup></a> Their
ceremonies were often painful, as the old writers report, and as
the words to express them, <i>kup</i>, to cut,
<i>ppeta</i>, to cry out with pain, testify.
This is also abundantly shown by the
pictures of scarifying the body and
transfixion of the tongue and ears, on
the monuments.</p>

<p class='c000'>They are said to have worn their
hair uncombed and long, often matted
with the blood of the sacrifices. The
expression for this was <i>hunhun buclah
u tzotzel hol</i>, (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">el que trae largos revueltos
y marañados los cabellos como los traen
los idolatras</span>. <cite>Dicc. Motul</cite>).</p>

<h3 id='h69' class='c012'>6. <i>Fanciful Analogies.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>It were easy in these names, myths, and pictures, to pick out
abundant analogies to the mythologies of Peru and Mexico, of
the Pueblos and of the Old World. It has been done over and
over again, usually with a total oversight of the only point in
which such analogies have much value—the similarity disclosed
the world over by independent evolutions of the religious sentiment.
The effort by such resemblances to prove identity of
historical origin is to be deprecated whenever the natural
growth of myths and rites will explain the facts considered.
For that reason I shall say nothing about “Tlaloc deities,” “serpent
gods,” etc., with which so many pages of other writers
have been fruitlessly taken up. That the adjacent nations of
equal culture influenced the people of Yucatan to some extent,
was no doubt a fact. It could not have been otherwise. But
that the Mayan mythology and civilization were distinctly independent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>and were only superficially touched by their neighbors,
I am deeply convinced.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, just how far the influence of this potent
and personal culture of the Mayas extended, it is difficult to
delimit. I have found no trace of its peculiar forms in South
America, nor anywhere in North America, beyond the boundaries
within which that extraordinary calendar was accepted,
upon which so much of it was based; but this, as I have shown
elsewhere, included not less than seven entirely different linguistic
stocks.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c014'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>7. <i>Total Number of Representations.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The actual progress toward an analysis of the pictorial elements
of the Codices which the above identifications indicate,
may best be shown by a few statistics.</p>

<p class='c000'>I find that the total number of figures of men and women, or
of anthropomorphic deities, which are preserved in the manuscripts,
is just about 950, of which 825 are males and 125 are
females.</p>

<p class='c000'>This gives a total of 638 figures which have been recognized;
in other words, more than three-fourths of the whole number.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the remainder a considerable portion are unimportant men
and persons, victims of sacrifice, captives, attendants, etc.;
others are priests or officiants in ceremonies; allowing for which,
it is certain that no prominent figure in Mayan mythology
under the human form remains to be discovered in the Codices.
This is a satisfactory result, and shows that, as far as their pictographs
go, the contents of these once mysterious volumes are
scarcely an unsolved enigma.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>8. <i>Figures of Quadrupeds.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The pictorial portions of the Codices contain delineations of
various animals, some of which are evidently introduced with
symbolical meanings, and others probably so.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dog, Maya, <i>pek</i>, is one of the most conspicuous. It is the
native breed, with smooth coat and erect ears. In many instances
it is associated with the sign for night, <i>akbal</i>, and with
the god of death (Cod. Tro., pp. 2, 3, 32, 33); also with the
storm and the lightning. For that reason Dr. Schellhas and Dr.
Seler regard him as a symbol of lightning.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c014'><sup>[95]</sup></a> But I am persuaded
that while not disconnected with this, the dog represents primarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>some star or constellation. At times he is dotted with
spots to represent stars, Cod. Dres., p. 21; the <i>akbal</i> sign refers to
the night. His body is often in human form, carrying a torch in
each hand, Cod. Dres., p. 39. (Compare Cod. Tro., p. 23*.) In
Cod. Dres., p. 40, he falls from the sky; and in ibid., p. 47, he is
slain by the shaft of Itzamna. (Compare id. 2, where Itzamna
is sitting upon him.) He plays on the medicine drum, Cod. Tro.,
p. 20, and is associated with the rains, id. pp. 26, 27. He represents
the end and beginning of time-periods, Cod. Cort., p. 32.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spotted leopard, the jaguar, Maya, <i>balam</i>, whose name
is attached to the Chacs, and which appears in the calendar and
in many of the myths of the Mayan stock, is represented in a
number of passages of the Codices, as Cod. Dres., pp. 8, 26; Cod.
Tro., pp. 17, 20, 21, 22. In one part, Cod. Tro., 14, he enters
dressed as a warrior with a human body.</p>

<p class='c000'>The monkey, <i>maax</i>, is not often depicted, but is found with
astronomic relations, Cod. Tro., 25*; his sign is distinguishable
by the markedly prognathic jaws.</p>

<p class='c000'>Deer are numerous, especially in the Cod. Troanus, where
the pages 9–12 are occupied with a series of pictures of the
animal in snares. On page 14 a large one is shown, sitting on
his rump, his organ erect and prominent. I have little doubt
these represent a constellation. In Cod. Dres., p. 2, a composite
figure with deer’s hoofs appears three times, sailing through the
sky on the serpent’s head. (Compare Cod. Cort., p. 14.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The small edentate, the nine-banded armadillo, <i>Tatusia novemcincta</i>,
in Maya, <i>ibach</i>, is shown twice in the Cod. Tro., both
times caught under a trap, once, p. 9, under the wind sign,
again, p. 22*, under the <i>cauac</i> sign. What it represents is unknown.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>9. <i>Figures of Birds.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>Birds had important symbolical functions, and a number are
figured in the Codices. In their identification I have had the
advantage of the advice of Mr. Witmer Stone, who has pursued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>his ornithological studies in Yucatan itself. The following
are recognizable:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. The red macaw, <i>Ara macao</i>, Maya, <i>moo</i> or <i>ahlo</i>; the type
is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_29'>29</a>. This was the symbol of Kin ich.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 29.</span>—Bird Symbols from the Codices.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>2. The horned or eared owl, a large raptorial bird of the
genus <i>Bubo</i>, Maya, <i>coz</i>.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c014'><sup>[96]</sup></a> He is usually shown in full face to
display his ears or horns, <i>e. g.</i>, Cod. Tro., 18*. He appears as
an associate of the gods of death and war, and symbolizes clouds,
darkness, and inauspicious events. His horns frequently appear
on the head-dress of Cuculcan to indicate the departing sun and
night, like the <i>akbal</i> sign. (See Cod. Tro., pp. 19, 29*, 35*.)
He is often associated with the number 13, and may represent
in the calendar the 13–day period.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Two species of vulture, the king vulture, <i>Vultus papa</i>, and
the turkey vulture, <i>Cathartes aura</i>, both abundant in Yucatan,
Maya, <i>kuch</i> and <i>ahchom</i>. The former is the bird seated on the
“tree of life,” tearing out the eyes of the victim, Cod. Dres., p. 3;
Cod. Tro., pp. 15, 17, or the entrails, Cod. Tro., p. 15, 17. The
naked head and neck of the vulture on a human body is seen
Cod. Dres., pp. 8, 13, 19, 38; Cod. Cort., p. 10, etc. His head
is his monogram, frequent in Cod. Peres., pp. 4, 7, 9, etc. (See
Fig. <a href='#fig_29'>29</a>, No. 2.) Its body is sometimes black, at others more or
less white.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The quetzal bird, <i>Trogon splendens</i>, is distinctly shown
in Cod. Dres., p. 16, above the middle figure.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>5. The crested falcon, <i>Spizætus tyrannus</i>, the <i>moan</i> bird, in
Maya <i>muan</i> or <i>muyan</i>. This has well-developed tufts of erectile
feathers on the head and resembles in the drawings the horned
owl. It is believed by Förstemann to be the symbol of the
Pleiades; by Seler, to be associated with the clouds and rains.
Both are probably correct.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c014'><sup>[97]</sup></a> (See Fig. <a href='#fig_28'>28</a>.)</p>

<p class='c000'>6. The pelican or cormorant is drawn with a human body and
the “fish and oysters” sign in Cod. Cort., pp. 20, 21.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Blackbirds, of which two species live in Yucatan, are portrayed
in Cod. Tro., p. 31.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. The wild turkey is easily recognized by his head and
“wattle” among the food offerings.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>10. <i>Figures of Reptiles.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>Among reptilians, the turtle or tortoise (Maya, <i>ac</i>) is one of
the most prominent. By Dr. Schellhas it has also been called a
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Blitzthier</span></i>, or animal symbolical of the lightning, basing his opinion
especially on Cod. Dres., p. 40, where a human figure with a
tortoise head is seen holding a torch in each hand. It is distinctly
represented as a celestial body in Cod. Cort., pp. 13, 17,
37, and 38; and when we are informed that the Mayas called a
portion of the constellation Gemini by the name “the tortoise,”
it is quite clear that we are dealing with an astronomical, not a
meteorological, emblem.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Förstemann has advanced the theory that at least one
and an important function of the tortoise was as a symbol of
the summer solstice, in accordance with which he explains Cod.
Dres., p. 40; and that on the earth-plane it indicated the northeast
and northwest directions. His arguments for this opinion,
if not conclusive, certainly attach to it a high probability.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Between the tortoise and the snail (Maya, <i>hub</i> or <i>ut</i>) there is
in the Codices some mythical relation. In the Aztec symbolism
the snail is often an emblem of death; but also of birth. It is
likely that the same holds true of the Maya designs. The animal
is associated distinctly with the beneficent deities, notably
with Itzamna and Cuculcan, Cod. Dres., 5 and 37. But it is also
visible in close relation with the god of death, Cod. Dres., pp. 9,
12, 13, 14, 23.</p>

<p class='c000'>Regarding it as a counterpart of the tortoise, Dr. Förstemann
has given various reasons for holding that it symbolizes the
winter solstice and the directions southwest and southeast, and
thinks it probable that it is found in the hieroglyph of the month
<i>mol</i>, which occurs about that season of the year.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c014'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The frog, Maya, <i>much</i>, <i>uo</i>, is a well-known symbol of water
and the rains. It is shown falling from the sky in Cod. Cort., p.
17; and on p. 12, Itzamna, in his character as a rain god, appears
with the body of one.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scorpion (Maya, <i>zinaan</i>) is depicted several times, especially
in Cod. Cort., p. 7, and Tro., pp. 9, 13, where it is of large
size. Its symbolic sense is not clear. The Mayas applied the
term <i>zinaan ek</i>, “scorpion stars,” to a certain constellation, but
it is possible they derived it from the Spaniards. Another possibility
is that the animal represents <i>the earth-plane</i>. The word
<i>zinaan</i> is derived from the radical <i>zin</i>, which means to stretch
out, to extend; and the entire earth, as one extended plane, was
called <i>zinil</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rattlesnake appears to be the only serpent which is represented
as a symbol. It was distinctively called, both in Tzental
and Maya, “the Snake King” (Maya, <i>ahau can</i>, Tzental, <i>aghau
chan</i>). Its rattles were termed <i>tzab</i>, and hence its name <i>ahau
tzab can</i>, also in use. According to the <cite>Dicc. Motul</cite>, the natives
believed there were four varieties, corresponding to the four
sacred colors, white, black, red, and yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>It is shown in the Codices, realistically, biting a man’s foot,
Tro., p. 7; astronomically, in the sky among the stars, Cod.
Dres., p. 43; Cort., pp. 12, 13; as the head-dress of the serpent
goddess, already described; as the companion of Itzamna and
Cuculcan, frequently; as the body of Itzamna, Cod. Cort., 10, in
Cod. Dres. and Cod. Tro. It carries the “constellation band,”
and may generally be regarded as one of the symbols of Time.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 30.</span>—A Religious Function. (From the Dresden Codex.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Among the illustrations are a number which throw light on
the habits and customs of the ancient Mayas. We see persons
engaged in spinning and weaving, Cod. Tro., pp. 11*, 16*, etc.,
Cod. Dres., p. 45; others making idols, Cod. Tro., p. 12*, Dres.,
p. 6, etc. Various religious ceremonies are pictured, as piercing
the tongue, Cod. Tro., pp. 16*, 17*; baptizing children, which
was performed at the age of four years,<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c014'><sup>[99]</sup></a> Cod. Tro., 20*; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>important functions at the end of the years, depicted both in
Cod. Tro., pp. 20–24, and Cod. Dres., pp. 25–28.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c014'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A curious scene is that Fig. <a href='#fig_29'>29</a>, from the Dresden MS., p. 35.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the center, resting upon an altar of three degrees surmounted
by the sign <i>caban</i>, earth, is the head of the god of fertility,
his soul escaping from his nostril. Below, on each side
of the altar, are two figures, one playing on a flute, the second
on the medicine drum. Above are also two, one shaking the
sacred rattle, the second squatted before a flaming altar, in one
hand the holy staff, <i>caluac</i>, while the other lifts above his head
the “fish and oyster” sign, symbol of the products of the sea.
On the right hand are other offerings, the turkey and the dog;
and below them a ladder, <i>eb-che</i>, probably signifying the day <i>eb</i>,
on which this ceremony took or should take place. Its successful
result is shown in the picture which follows it in the Codex.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c000'>Those who would follow Förstemann’s (and my own) views in
understanding the Codices, must accustom themselves to look
upon the animals, plants, objects, and transactions they depict
as largely symbolic, representing the movements of the celestial
bodies, the changes of the seasons, the meteorological variations,
the revolutions of the sun, moon, and planets, and the
like; just as in the ancient zodiacs of the Old World we find
similar uncouth animals and impossible collocations of images
presented. The great snakes which stretch across the pages of
the Codices mean Time; the torches in the hands of figures,
often one downward and one upward, indicate the rising and the
setting of constellations; the tortoise and the snail mark the
solstices; the mummied bodies, the disappearance from the sky
at certain seasons of certain stars, etc. A higher, a more pregnant,
and, I believe, the only correct meaning is thus awarded to
these strange memorials.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>IV. The Graphic Elements.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Having made this satisfactory progress in explaining the
numeral and the pictorial portions of the Codices, we are well
prepared to approach the more difficult part of our task, the
interpretations of the hieroglyphs themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately, an even superficial inspection of the manuscripts
shows us that we are not without material aids to this end. It
is clear that many of the hieroglyphs are those of the twenty
days and the eighteen months of the Maya year, which are preserved
to us in the work of Bishop Landa; others, again, by
their arrangement, must be connected with the cardinal points;
and others suggest, by their appearance and disposition, that they
portray the celestial bodies, the sun, moon, and stars; others are
in the columns of numerals, and must have numerical values;
and others are so related to the pictures that they are plainly a
repetition of them in a partial and conventional manner, as the
written characters for divinities, which are usually merely the
head of the divinity more or less cursively expressed.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>1. <i>The Direction in which the Glyphs are to be read.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The first step in the decipherment of any inscription is to ascertain
the direction in which it is to be read.</p>

<p class='c000'>In my earliest essay on this subject,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c014'><sup>[101]</sup></a> I stated that whatever
the prevailing rule in this respect might have been, the native
artists had no hesitation in disregarding it, when artistic or
other reasons presented themselves. This is the conclusion
which has since been arrived at by conservative later students.
I shall have numerous illustrations of it to offer in the following
pages. Most of the diversity in this respect was not capricious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>however, but in accordance with rules, some of which have been
ascertained.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three points in this connection will immediately attract the
attention of the student. The movement of the principal figures
in the records, both manuscript and mural, is generally
from right to left; the main portion of the composite characters
are drawn on the right, and the minor portions or affixes
are added on the left;<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c014'><sup>[102]</sup></a> and in placing numerals on a line, the
upright strokes which mean the fives are placed to the right, and
the dots which mean units less than five are placed to the left.
These facts look as if the lines were <i>written</i> from right to left.
The general opinion, however, is that expressed by Pousse and
by Thomas, that the characters when arranged in lines are to
be read from left to right, and when in columns from top to bottom.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c014'><sup>[103]</sup></a>
That this rule does not hold good in a number of instances,
as I shall show, need not surprise us, as precisely the
same uncertainty in the arrangement is found in the Mexican
picture-writing, as Chavero has pointed out,<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c014'><sup>[104]</sup></a> and exists to-day
in the manuscripts of the Tuaregs of the Sahara.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c014'><sup>[105]</sup></a> Dr. Förstemann
has shown conclusively that the numerical elements in
the long computations to which I have referred (above p. 30)
are to be read from below upward and from right to left.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c014'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Great aid in settling this question in any given instance can
be obtained by a close examination of the <i>rubrication</i> of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>manuscript. The native scribe, before he filled in the glyphs or
letters, divided his sheet into small compartments by faint red
lines, bounding as it were the different sentences or paragraphs
he intended to set down. Each such sentence consists usually
of four or six characters, arranged either in a column or in a
square, the whole of which may be called a “cartouche.” The
following diagram illustrates the manner in which the separate
glyphs are to be read in ordinary cases:—</p>

</table>

<p class='c000'>Without the aid of the rubrics, from an independent study of
the characters themselves, M. Pousse demonstrated that this
is a necessary arrangement of the majority of the written passages.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c014'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The signs for the days are usually placed in columns on the
left of the groups of hieroglyphic characters, the numeral belonging
to each being inscribed above it; while immediately
below the groups are numerals in black and red, generally indicating
certain days. This disposition of the elements of the
writing shows that it was intended for a “time-count,” as I have
before stated. For the somewhat voluminous analysis of the
Codices in this direction, the reader is referred to the works of
Förstemann and Thomas, who have paid fruitful attention to
this department.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>2. <i>Composition of the Glyphs.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I have already stated, p. 10, that the main elements of the
Mayan hieroglyphic writing are not numerous. The apparent
complexity of many of the glyphs arises from the combination
of a number of frequently recurring elements which are placed
in different positions and relations, and each of which has many
variant forms, dependent on the degree of skill or care of the
scribe or sculptor, and the material which he used for the record.</p>

<p class='c000'>Usually each glyph or katun consists of one main element
with a number of others drawn in or around it, which are generally
known as “affixes.” An element within another is called
an “infix;” placed in front of it, a “prefix;” behind it, a “suffix”
or “postfix;” above it, a “superfix;” and below it, a “subfix.”
The same element will often be found first in one and
then in another of these positions; and a certain class of elements
are employed as affixes only. I shall refer to the single
elements as “simple characters,” and to the complex glyphs as
“composite characters.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>3. <i>The Proper Method of Studying the Glyphs.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The proper method to adopt in studying composite characters
is first carefully to separate them into the simple characters of
which they are composed, noting the relative positions of these.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next step is vitally important and often most difficult. It
is to determine what visible objects these simple characters were
intended to represent. They are often so conventionalized or so
negligently sketched that the most careful students have reached
absurdly different opinions as to what they were designed to
portray.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c014'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This identification accomplished, the student should proceed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>ascertain the name of the object in the Maya language; because,
though it may be employed as pure ideogram in one connection,
in another it may be used for its phonetic value according to the
“ikonomatic,” or rebus method, as I have above explained, and
instances of which I give in these pages. I do not believe that
a further phonetic analysis—that to the isolation of distinct
alphabetic elements—as has been pursued by a number of
writers already referred to, is justified by the nature of the Maya
script, or will yield useful results.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>4. <i>An Analysis of Various Graphic Elements.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>I shall now proceed, in the manner above described, to examine
a number of simple and composite characters, not by any
means exhausting the stock, but rather merely offering suggestions
and examples for future students. In their application it
must always be remembered that any Maya character may be
employed in either of three values: 1, As an ideogram; 2, as a
rebus; 3, as an astronomical or numerical sign.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 31.</span>—The Hand.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The <i>hand</i> contributes to some of the most numerous hieroglyphs
in the Mayan writing; and the significant poses assigned
it in the pictures and statues prove how expressive it was to this
people.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>The forms presented in<a id='t83'></a> Fig. <a href='#fig_30'>30</a> by no means exhaust its delineations.
They are drawn from gesture-speech and each is significant.
No. 1, from the Cod. Cort., is the usual sign “to give;”
No. 2, from the Cod. Tro., shows it in hasty writing; No. 3 is
the hand closing (“la main qui se ferme,” Brasseur). It is the
sign for the day <i>manik</i>, and is explained by Dr. Seler, “to eat;”
but I take it to be the rebus for <i>mach</i>, “to grasp” (“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">asir, tomar con
las manos</span>,” <cite>Dic. Motul</cite>). No. 4, the hand closed, thumb downward
(<i>pollice verso</i>), has probably an inauspicious significance
(very common, <i>e. g.</i>, Cod. Per., pp. 2, 3, 6, 7); No. 5 is the
“supporting hand” (very frequent, usually in composition); No.
6 is intended to show the hand, palm upward, forming a cup
(Cod. Dres., p. 40, Cod. Tro., p. 21),—it would signify “offering;”
No. 6½, from the stelæ of Copan, must mean union or friendship.
The two hands held as No. 7 occur repeatedly in Cod.
Dres., pp. 6, 7, in the Tro. and Cort. often thus, <img src='images/illus-083.jpg' alt='' class='ig' />, to which
Thomas, by means of his “key,” assigns the wonderful meaning,
“a meat pie”! Nos. 8 and 9 are explained by Seler as the
supporting hand; No. 10 shows the hand and arm pointing; No.
12, Cod. Tro., 30, 31, is the index finger extended; No. 11, Cort.,
p. 28, shows the closed hand as a suffix to the sign <i>ik</i>.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c014'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Phonetically the hand is <i>kab</i>, which also means “arm, finger,
juice, sap, tears;” and as a rebus it could stand for <i>kaba</i>, name.</p>

<p class='c000'>By some writers all the signs, Fig. <a href='#fig_32'>32</a> are supposed to
represent the <i>eye</i>. Nos. 1 and 2 may also stand for a tooth, and
for the small bells worn as ornaments. No. 3 has been called
the “weeping eye,” and by Brasseur “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une hache</span>;” but I take it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>to be the space within the closing hand (Figs. <a href='#fig_31'>31</a>, No. 3).
No. 4 shows the eyelashes of the closed eye, and signifies sleep
or death. No. 5 is the “ornamented” or “serpent” eye, and,
according to Thomas, is the characteristic of a deity. Nos. 6
and 8 are supposed by Seler to be the eye torn out. They are
extremely common affixes. Schellhas explains No. 6 as “the
head and creeping foot of a snail.” I am persuaded that it is a
bird’s wing, or the chief feather of a wing, and means “superior,”
“supremacy,” or something of that kind.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c014'><sup>[110]</sup></a> For that
reason it always appears in the sign of Kin ich ahau. No. 8
I regard also as copied from a feather ornament.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c014'><sup>[111]</sup></a> No. 7, called
by Seler the “bleeding eye,” I take to be a sign for stars.</p>

are from the pottery of that city, on which it is the most common
glyph I have noted. In No. 5, from Cod. Dres., p. 57, it is
postfixed to a human figure reversed. Brasseur explains it as
“the spectacles of Tezcatlipoca,” and for a name, we may call it
“the spectacles glyph.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The human <i>ear</i> has been represented by No. 2, Fig. <a href='#fig_34'>34</a>, as has
been proved by de Rosny and Thomas. No. 1 (Cod. Cort., p.
16) is either an ear or an ear ornament. It is not the ordinary
ear-ring, which is clearly shown in Figs. <a href='#fig_12'>12</a>, <a href='#fig_17'>17</a>, etc. This latter is
often used as an affix, and has been confused with the serpent
rattle, and with No. 3, which is the lower jaw bone, <i>cham</i> or
<i>camach</i>. (See Cod. Cort., pp. 35, 36, etc.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The ear is <i>xicin</i>, which also means “shell.” Ear-rings are
<i>tup</i>, a word which as a verb signifies “to stop up, to cover over,
to extinguish.”<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c014'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>The group of signs, Fig. <a href='#fig_35'>35</a>, beginning with a person seated,
are, in the opinion of Seler, all derivatives from “man.” Nos. 2,
3, and 4 he calls “eyes,” and Nos. 5–11 outlines of the mouth,
jaws, and face, with a general value, “person.” Other suggestions
are, that the crescentic outlines, Nos. 6, 7, 11, refer to a
crescent moon, or an ear (Schellhas), or to a serpent’s mouth
(Allen); while No. 10 may be an eye and eyelashes (Allen), a
comb (Valentini), a claw, a feather, part of a plant, etc. It may
be called the “comb sign.”<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c014'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>My belief is that some of these affixes show the necklace on
which beads and precious stones were strung. This was called
<i>u</i>, which is also the word for moon, and in sound is akin to <i>uil</i>,
food.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c014'><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>By the latter fact I would explain the frequent appearance of
this sign <img src='images/illus-086b.jpg' alt='' class='ig' /> on the neck of vases and on haunches
of venison (Cod. Tro. 22, etc.). The picture of a necklace shown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>in the <cite><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Lienzo de Tlascala</span></cite>, p. 7, will demonstrate how close is
the resemblance. That in Landa’s alphabet (see above, p. 15)
this sign is given for <i>u</i>, confirms my supposition.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 36.</span>—Sun and Moon Signs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The hieroglyphs of the <i>sun</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_36'>36</a>, Nos. 1 and 2, cannot be
mistaken. In the latter, the four teeth indicate the biting heat.
This design often occurs on war shields. No. 1 is that usually
employed in composition. The word for sun is <i>kin</i>, which has
the further meanings, “day, light, festival, time, news, to rule;”
from it are derived <i>kinal</i>, “heat, hot;” <i>kinam</i>, “strength, bravery,
power, poison, fear, veneration;” <i>ah-kin</i>, “a priest,” etc.
The <i>kin</i> sign usually indicates a beneficent divinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third sign in Fig. <a href='#fig_36'>36</a> is that for moon (Schellhas). Dr.
Seler, however, claims that it is the symbol of “night,” and that
where it means 20 (see above, p. 21), it is not derived from <i>u</i>,
moon, but from <i>uinic</i>, man. He explains the figure as a human
head with a “bleeding eye,” and bare teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all these points I think he is in error. Maya grammar does
not authorize the derivation of <i>uinal</i> from <i>uinic</i> (in which Seler
follows Brasseur); but it may come from <i>u</i>, month, <i>uin</i> or <i>uen</i>,
“relating to a month.” His statement that the 20–day period
was not spoken of as an <i>uinal</i>, is disproved by Landa, who calls
it <i>uinal hun ekeh</i>, “a dark month,” to distinguish it from one
lighted by the moon. A close examination of most of the
drawings will show that the line on which the supposed bare
teeth are shown is not that of the mouth, but that of the necklace
above mentioned, which has the value <i>u</i>. Cf. Fig. <a href='#fig_3'>3</a>, No. 3.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>No. 1, Fig. <a href='#fig_37'>37</a>, I introduce from Mexican pictography; it is
the sacred green jade jewel, the <i>xihuitl</i>, meaning “precious,
divine.” By it I explain the very common No. 2, a modification
either of it or of the <i>kin</i> sign, constantly associated with deities
(on the hand, Cod. Dres., p. 21; on the leg, id., 12; on the back,
id., 39; and always on the head-dress of the God of Growth).</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>No. 3 may be a modification of the <i>kin</i>. It is given in
Landa’s alphabet, where it stands for <i>be</i>, footprints. It may
also be the stones of the hearth, and signify “house.” As a
“directive sign,” it stands for the point south, and the color
yellow; and it appears as an occasional variant of the day-signs
<i>lamat</i>, <i>muluc</i>, and <i>chuen</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 4 is thought by Seler to be merely an ornamental form of
the <i>kin</i> sign; but by Förstemann is taken for the monogram of
the planet Venus, at least in the Cod. Dres., where it is very
frequent on pp. 46–50. It is repeated with slight variations on
the Copan pottery.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 38.</span>—The Knife Signs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The flint knife was an important implement. Landa speaks
of the numerous large ones kept by the priests for slaughtering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>their victims.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c014'><sup>[115]</sup></a> They were called <i>ta</i>, and <i>licil dzicil</i>; in Tzental,
<i>chinax</i>, from <i>chi</i>, to bite. Fig. <a href='#fig_38'>38</a>, Nos. 1, 2, and 4, show the usual
forms in which they are drawn, the small squares at the end being
the biting edges. No. 3, surmounted by the “trinal” sign, refers
probably to lightning. No. 6 is a rare sign for a dog, showing
his biting teeth (Cod. Tro., p. 25). The flint knife typifies sacrifice,
death, war, the East, and fire. As a rebus, it could stand for
<i>ta</i>, excrement; <i>tah</i>, a dramatic representation, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 5 is a very common affix. It has been regarded as a
variant of the knife (Seler, etc). But it is too constantly distinguished
from it to have this meaning. I consider it the sacred
bean, with which divination was practiced and lots cast. This
was called <i>bul</i>, a word which, as an affix, means “all,” the whole
of anything, as <i>bulkin</i>, “the whole day.” This may suggest its
signification.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 39.</span>—The “Fish and Oyster” Sign.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The curious objects in Fig. <a href='#fig_39'>39</a> were long a puzzle to me, and
have not been explained by previous writers. I believe them
to be representations of the
food products of the sea,
showing a fish and two shellfish.
My reasons for this are
that in Cod. Dres., p. 34, they
are seen along with other
food-offerings (see Fig. <a href='#fig_30'>30</a>);
in some places the fish tail is unmistakeable (Cod. Dres., pp. 6,
7, 36); in Cod. Cort., pp. 20, 21, they are associated with a fishing
bird,—a pelican or cormorant; in Cod. Dres., p. 50, the two
shells are replaced by one conch shell; and in Cod. Dres., p. 67,
a fish and two shells are painted separately, to represent food
from the sea. The two shells are often seen in other relations, as
sprinkled with blood (Cod. Tro., p. 18*), and as an affix (see Fig.
31, No. 10). I shall refer to this as the “fish and oyster” sign.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Shells had a peculiar sacredness in Maya symbolism. The

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 40.</span>—The Sacred Food-Offerings.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Some other sacred food-offerings are shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_40'>40</a>. The
first is the haunch of venison tied up (identified as such by Brasseur);
the second is the fish, here shown with a subfix; the third
is the wild turkey, represented by his head in a dish. Another
is the iguana (see p. 122, No. 14); and a fifth is the object shown
on p. 122, No. 12. It has been explained as a grain of corn
sprouting from the ground, or a mole emerging from its hole
(Schellhas). The true explanation is that of Brasseur, that it portrays
the forequarter and head of a food-animal, tied up. He
does not specify what animal, but in some of the drawings I distinctly
recognize the dog, with his sharp teeth, the species raised
by the Mayas to be eaten on festival occasions, as stated by Landa.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c014'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 41.</span>—The <i>ben-ik</i> and other Signs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nos. 1 and 2, Fig. <a href='#fig_41'>41</a>, are variants of an element often occurring
with a <i>ben-ik</i> superfix. Dr. Seler, who is apt to see gory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>human heads everywhere, thinks it is one carried in a sling and
means “conquered in war.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Förstemann, with greater probability, considers that it
symbolizes an astronomical event connected with the motions of
the sun. (See the significant designs, Cod. Tro., 28* <i>b</i>.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>ben-ik</i> sign referred to is rendered by Seler to mean conquest
and destruction; by Förstemann, astronomically, as the
lunar month of 29 days; in a general sense, I would say,
“strength and deific power.” It is a very constant association
of the two day-signs so named, <i>ben</i> giving the idea of motion,
and <i>ik</i> of life and power.</p>

<p class='c000'>In No. 3 is a long worm-like figure under the <i>ben-ik</i> sign. Brasseur
pointed out that it is a variant of the day-sign <i>men</i>, and explained
it as a caterpillar (<i>chenille</i>). Seler speaks of it as an
eagle, and as a symbol of “mother earth;” Schellhas, as perhaps
the serpent goddess. It sometimes is drawn to have a fish-like
appearance (Cod. Per., p. 7), and may symbolize the waters; the
more so as it has occasionally as a superfix the “cloud-balls.”</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 4 is explained by Brasseur as the girdle, <i>xoc</i>, around the
body; and I prefer this to later suggestions. A similar design
was the tress of hair, <i>kax pol</i> or <i>kaaxi</i>, worn by women (see Cod.
Tro., p. 27; Cod. Dres., p. 45). Its signification would seem to
be “to tie together, to join,” or, as a rebus, “rain, to rain,” for
<i>kaxala</i> (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">llover, y la lluvia</span>).</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 42.</span>—The Drum Signs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>No more prominent hieroglyph than No. 1, Fig. <a href='#fig_42'>42</a>, can be
found in the Mayan inscriptions, and none which has proved
such a stumbling block to interpreters. Valentini has called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>it the picture of a censer or brazier; de Rosny thought it a
variant of the <i>ahau</i> sign; Dr. Seler explained it as a precious
stone; and Thomas as “a stone heap!” It is the upper figure
in the “Initial Series” of glyphs at Palenque, Copan, Quirigua,
etc. (see above, p. 24), and recurs with but slight variations in
all the Codices.</p>

<p class='c000'>I first announced what it represents and its signification at
the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, August, 1894.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c014'><sup>[118]</sup></a> It is the picture of a <i>drum</i>, the
large variety, made of the hollow trunk of a tree resting upon
short feet, the trunk being sawed across partly through so as
to give two vibrating surfaces, which were often decorated with
cross-hatching. Such drums are described by the early Spanish
writers, and one is shown in the Atlas to Duran’s History.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c014'><sup>[119]</sup></a> Their
sound could be heard for two leagues, and they were important
adjuvants in the services in the temples.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the hieroglyphics the significance of this design is primarily
phonetic. The name of this particular kind of drum
was <i>pax che</i>, from <i>pax</i>, musical instrument, and <i>che</i>, wooden; a
large one was <i>bolon pax che</i>, the word <i>bolon</i>, nine, being a superlative
prefix in Maya. Employed according to the ikonomatic
method, this expressed the word <i>paxan</i>, a very common term in
Maya, meaning “it is finished,” and applied to anything completed,
ended, or destroyed, in a good or bad sense.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c014'><sup>[120]</sup></a> This is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>why in the numeral signs it marks the end of a series (see above,
p. 22), and in the so-called “Initial Series” (which I believe to
be terminal), it surmounts and thus closes (reading from below
upward) the rows of computation signs. For the same reason
it is the support of the figure representing the dying year in the
ceremonies at its termination (Cod. Tro., pp. 20–24), and is often
associated with the deities of old age, destruction, and death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several other varieties of drums were in use among the
Mayas. That shown Fig. <a href='#fig_42'>42</a><a id='t93'></a> No. 2, is noteworthy. It is the <i>dzacatan</i>
(Berendt), or medicine-drum (from <i>dzacah</i>, to cure, to practice
medicine). It was used in the sacred ceremonies (see Fig.
30), and Itzamna is portrayed playing upon one (Cod. Dres., p.
34). Its representations in the Codices are peculiar, and have
been entirely misunderstood by previous writers. I show them
in Fig. <a href='#fig_43'>43</a>, Nos. 1, 2, 3. In a more highly conventionalized form
we find them in the Cod. Troano, thus: <img src='images/illus-093.jpg' alt='' class='ig' /> which has
been explained by Pousse, Thomas, and others, as making fire
or as grinding paint. It is obviously the <i>dzacatan</i>, what I have
called the “pottery decoration” (see p. 58) around the figures,
showing that the body of the drum was of earthenware.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fig. <a href='#fig_42'>42</a>, No. 3 shows the ordinary hand drum, the <i>huehuetl</i> of
the Mexicans. Its name in Maya is <i>tunkul</i>, properly <i>tankul</i>, which
means either “before the gods,” or “now one worships” (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ahora
se adora, Baeza</span>.) It was either of wood and was struck with a
stick; or of pottery with a skin stretched over its mouth, when
the sound was produced by the fingers. Some were large and
stood upright, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_43'>43</a>.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c014'><sup>[121]</sup></a> Representations of these are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>common in the Codices, and have generally been mistaken for
vases. (See Cod. Cort., p. 27.) Even Nos. 4 and 5, Fig. <a href='#fig_44'>44</a>, are
probably some such musical instruments. (See Cod. Cort., pp.
12, 30, 31.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Few glyphs are more frequent than No. 1, Fig. <a href='#fig_45'>45</a>, either
alone or in such combinations as Nos. 2 and 3. The guesses as
to what it represents have been singularly divergent. Brasseur
said, a kind of gourd; Seler, a tree; Schellhas, the zapote;
Rosny and Förstemann, the phallus, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>None of these suggestions seems to me tenable. I believe it
represents a common feather decoration made of short green or
blue feathers, attached to a style or staff. It is frequent on
Mexican and Maya figures, and in No. 4, Fig. <a href='#fig_45'>45</a>, I copy one
from a Maya war dress. The lower portion represents the ornament
to which I allude. It was called <i>yax kukul</i>, and this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>gives the phonetic rebus value of the sign, which is <i>yax</i>, green,
and (metaphorically) new, young, fresh, strong, virile, etc.</p>

<div  class='figleft id033'>
<img src='images/illus-095a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Care must be taken not to confound this with the character
seen in the sign of the dog (see p. 70), which really represents
the ribs and breast-bone, although called a “phallus” by
Rosny, an “article of food” by Thomas, a “breastplate”
by Allen, and a “vertebral column” by Seler.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c014'><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The three feathers which surmounted the <i>yax kukul</i>, as shown
in No. 4, Fig. <a href='#fig_45'>45</a>, also developed in the hieroglyphs to an important
sign. It is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_46'>46</a>, No. 1, and is the uppermost sign
in the “Initial glyph” of Palenque (see p. 137) and was a mark
of eminent distinction. (See Fig. <a href='#fig_47'>47</a>, No. 2.)</p>

<p class='c000'>These three feathers indicated in Maya symbolism the highest
place and power. They appear on the head of the important
statue unearthed by Dr. Le Plongeon at Chichen Itza,
which he calls “Chac Mool,” in the form given Fig. <a href='#fig_46'>46</a>, No.
2. Three was a sacred number with the Mayas, and with this
in mind I shall refer to it as the “trinal” sign.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Mexican writing the three

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A number of drawings in the Codices represent textile materials—mats,
cotton cloth, wicker-work, etc. That Fig. <a href='#fig_47'>47</a>, No. 1
is frequent, both as an affix and as
part of costume. Thomas calls
it a trellis or lattice work; Seler,
an imitation of a snake skin;
Förstemann, of the shell of a tortoise.
In some places it is clearly
a part of a helmet made of interlaced
and twisted cords attached
to a frame. (See Cod. Tro., pp.
2, 3, 6, 19, 22*, 23*.)<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c014'><sup>[123]</sup></a> In Nos. 2 and 3 it appears as a written
character with superfixes. It forms part of the sign of the day
<i>chicchan</i>, and is attached to the sign of the sun and of the
world.</p>

<p class='c000'>This cross-hatching I regard as showing woven stuff, or that
twisted, knotted, and plaited; and I consider its value when used
phonetically to be “strong, mighty,” because the word for
“strong” in Maya is <i>chich</i>, and that for twisting and interlacing
cords is <i>chich-kuch</i>,—again a simple rebus.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c014'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The designs, on p. 129, are supposed by Seler and Thomas to
represent a house, the roof of which is indicated by the cross-hatched
or plaited objects, <img src='images/illus-096b.jpg' alt='' class='ig' /> and <img src='images/illus-096c.jpg' alt='' class='ig' />.
I regard them as meaning a <i>canopy</i>, the practical and symbolic

it portrays the wing of a bird, the foot of an animal, the claw of
a reptile or insect, or the tail of a dog (Cod. Tro., p. 27).</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 2 is the conventional sign for <i>smoke</i>, as may be seen in

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 49.</span>—The Use of Dots.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>No. 4 I introduce from the Mexican pictography to illustrate
the use of black dots. They have many significations
which I have not traced in Mayan Codices, such as seed, salt,
ashes, stars, sand, earth, and from the latter, place, region, world.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c014'><sup>[126]</sup></a>
In the sign for the day, <i>ix</i>, I believe we see the dots with the
signification <i>xiix</i>, “grain-husks.” A line or lines of dots
mean “speech” or vocal sound, as
attached to the drum, Fig. <a href='#fig_44'>44</a>, No. 3;
coming from the mouth of a dog, Cod.
Tro., p. 20, singing, etc. Some have
mistaken this for the sign of death.
Dots in Maya are <i>ua</i> or <i>ual</i>, akin in sound to <i>u</i>, month, <i>uil</i>, food,
and may be allusive for these ideas.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>The <i>kan</i> and <i>imix</i> signs are often associated under two superfixes
enclosing dots, as in Fig. <a href='#fig_49'>49</a>, No. 1. These have been
interpreted by Seler to indicate copal gum, or the burning of
incense. The sign is associated with various deities, especially
those of a beneficent character.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same objects, however, occur elsewhere as superfixes
over various glyphs, as Fig. <a href='#fig_49'>49</a>, No. 2, where it is not easy to
assign them any such meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Modifications of Fig.
50, No. 1 are quite frequent.
This sign has
had various explanations,
as typifying fire,
lightning, or wind
(Seler, Schellhas); but
I believe it represents
divine or magical power
exerted by blowing. As I have explained in my <cite>Nagualism</cite>,
“the act of blowing was the essential feature in the practice of
the ‘medicine men.’ It symbolized the exercise and transfer of
spiritual power.”<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c014'><sup>[127]</sup></a> Where the deity is portrayed with this addition,
he is in the act of exerting his divine influence. For
examples, see the “bee god,” in Cod. Tro., pp. 5* and 10*,
where the head is as in No. 2; and the scorpion, in Cod. Tro.,
p. 2, precisely like one in the Cod. Porfirio Diaz, lam. <span class='fss'>I</span>. At
times it also conveys the idea of speech, or vocal sound, or that
from a drum, etc., <i>e. g.</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_44'>44</a>, No. 3.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 3 represents the usual mode of portraying the antennæ of
scorpions, insects, etc., of interest because the word for these in
Maya, <i>matzab</i>, also means the rays of the sun and of light, and
the figure might so be interpreted.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Dr. Förstemann believes that the circle of dots, as in the
lower portion of No. 2, means “movement or precession;” as in
Cod. Dres., p. 68. The <img src='images/illus-099a.jpg' alt='' class='ig' /> sign is so surrounded, indicating
the junction of two time-periods; or, as others would say, the
crooked lightning darting from the sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Fig. <a href='#fig_51'>51</a>, Nos. 1 and 2, copied from the great tortoise of
Copan, show the rain-clouds as conceived by the native artist.
In the Codices they are seen in the day-sign <i>cauac</i>; and
elsewhere. An almost identical conception appears in the
pictography of the northern tribes.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c014'><sup>[128]</sup></a> Seler speaks of them as
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wolkenballen</span></i>, “cloud-balls,” an appropriate name for the element.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 3 has been explained by Thomas and Seler as the portrayal
of trickling fluid; or, again, by the latter, as a “nose
ornament.” Dr. Schellhas first saw its real intention. It is a
picture of a twisted lock of hair, or “cork-screw curl,” worn by
the Maya women. It appears in the monograms of various goddesses.
Ideographically it has two meanings, one, woman or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>female; the other, down or downward; either from its name
(which we do not know), or because it hangs downward. In the
latter sense, it is in the hieroglyph of the Earth, as that which is
down or below us, Fig. <a href='#fig_52'>52</a>; although, as the Earth is the feminine
principle in nature,—Mother Earth,—I would suggest that this
is the intimation conveyed by the sign.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 1, Fig. <a href='#fig_53'>53</a>, occurs with great frequency. Allen explains
it as “the radical of the mouth,” others as “falling water,” etc.,
but I accept without hesitation Brasseur’s identification of it as
the side view of the joint of a reed or maize stalk, with the
meaning “union.” In the writing it is probably among other
things the conjunctive conjunction, <i>yetal</i>, “and,” which explains
its frequency. It is common in the form No. 2, in the Vienna
Codex, signifying the union of day series (pp. 58, 61, 64, etc.);
it may imply sexual union, as in the “Tableau des Bacabs” (see
above, p. 50.)</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>perhaps indicates the union of two month periods, or the new and
old moons, in relation. The middle design between the two
crescents is frequent as an affix (<i>e. g.</i>, Cod. Tro., p. 7, etc.).</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 55.</span>—The “Tree of Life.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I have already hinted at the significance of the “tree of life”
in Mayan mythology. It is shown in the Codices under two
forms, Fig. <a href='#fig_55'>55</a>, Nos. 1 and 2. In the former it seems to be
growing from a bottle-shaped vase. The leaves (omitted in this
instance) are well shown in Cod. Tro., p. 17*. They are cordate
and pendent.</p>

<p class='c000'>No. 2 is taken from the Cod. Peres., p. 3; it beautifully shows
the sacred tree, here distinctly anthropomorphic,<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c014'><sup>[129]</sup></a> in the vase
of the heavenly waters, lifting its fourfold branches. In the
original, the god of the north star is resting upon them. Usually
the tree is associated with Itzamna. Both forms are frequent in
the Mexican manuscripts, and the myths relating to them have
been subjects of study by various writers.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c014'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Forms like Nos. 1 and 2, Fig. <a href='#fig_56'>56</a>, and perhaps No. 3, are usually
taken to represent a chopper or <i>machete</i>. The representation of
this weapon or implement is seen in Cod. Tro., p. 17, where
a man is killing a snake with one. In the conventional and
negligent manner in which these characters are often written, it
is not easy to distinguish them from others of different origin
and meaning. Nos. 2 and 3 may be feather signs. Seler explains
the machete as the symbol of striking or wounding (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ausdruck
des Schlagens</span>”).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Characters like the above recur in all the forms of writing.
No. 1 has been called by Seler the representation of “man,”
but this is doubtful. It may be a variant of No. 2, which is a
“closing hand” from Fig. <a href='#fig_31'>31</a>, No. 3. Nos. 3 and 4, from Copan
and Guatemalan pottery, follow closely the Codices. With a
“comb affix,” Förstemann calls No. 4 “a well-known form of
<i>moan</i>,” meaning the Pleiades (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Entziff.</span></cite> IV); while Dr. Seler
explains it as an owl symbol. The design enclosed is held to
depict the bill of a bird.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Crotalean curve,” the outline of the jaws of the rattlesnake,
<i>Crotalus horridus</i>, has been dwelt upon with emphasis by
Allen and Maudslay as one of the most notable emblems in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Maya art.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c014'><sup>[131]</sup></a> Fig. <a href='#fig_58'>58</a>, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, show some of its forms in

<p class='c000'>Fig. <a href='#fig_59'>59</a>, Nos. 1–4, are outlines of objects often seen in the

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>No. 2 is the “medicine rattle.” Sometimes it was a gourd,
at others of earthenware, as we see by the “pottery decoration”
in Cod. Tro., 34, 35, etc. Sometimes it looks like a fan or a
mirror.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c014'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>No. 3 is the hatchet, and No. 4 the chisel. The peculiar
shape and mode of use of the latter are seen Cod. Tro., 34, etc.
Both of these implements were made of metal obtained from
Tabasco, and Landa especially says that the latter was that
with which they carved their idols, exactly as we see in the
MSS.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c014'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The word for the tomahawk in Maya was <i>bat</i>; and from the
same root come <i>batul</i>, “to fight;” <i>batab</i>, “a chief;” <i>batan</i>, “first
or in front of;” <i>bat</i>, “hail;” for any of which ideas the weapon
might be a symbol or a rebus. It is of frequent occurrence in
the texts. One of its uses, I am persuaded, was to indicate a
thunderbolt or stroke of lightning. The name for this in Maya
was “the blow of the cloud,”<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c014'><sup>[134]</sup></a> and in the group of the <i>moan</i>
sign and the tomahawk we have this well expressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first design in Fig. <a href='#fig_60'>60</a> shows the aspersorium, <i>lilābal</i>,
with which the high priest sprinkled the holy water (which was
the dew collected in the early morning) during the ceremonies.
To it were attached the rattles of the rattlesnake and tails of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>poisonous serpents.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c014'><sup>[135]</sup></a> It is often portrayed in the Codices and
inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second design is the throwing-stick, in Nahuatl, <i>atlatl</i>.
The admirable monograph of Mrs. Zelia Nuttall explains its important
symbolic uses.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c014'><sup>[136]</sup></a> Examples where it is well portrayed
are: Cod. Dres., p. 60, 65; Cod. Tro., pp. 21* and 22*.</p>

<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">escobilla</span></i>, Nahuatl, <i>mallinalli</i>,) and Schellhas, a feather. But
that it is, as Brasseur said, a mimosa, seems clear from Cod.
Tro., p. 29, where it is shown growing. In id., p. 32*<sup>c</sup>, where it
is above the turtle, it has an astronomic significance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other objects sometimes depicted are fans, <i>ual</i> or <i>picit</i>; mirrors,
<i>nen</i>; shields, <i>chimal</i>; and planting sticks, <i>xul</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The designs shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_61'>61</a> recur in all the Codices, and I
agree with Dr. Förstemann that they must refer to the celestial
bodies and their relative motions (contrary to the view of Dr.
Seler). That they have not all been identified is perhaps because
none of the students of the subject has been astronomer enough
to understand the lessons they convey.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few we are certain about. No. 1 is the sun, No. 2 the
moon; No. 13 must be “the rope of the moon” (see above p. 36)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>indicating its conjunction;<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c014'><sup>[137]</sup></a> No. 12, from the Cod. Peres., might
reasonably indicate its opposition; No. 14 is the pole star,
occurring in Cod. Tro., pp. 20, 22, 23. Dr. Förstemann has
offered certain reasons, reaching a moderate probability, that
Nos. 3 and 4 symbolize the planet Mercury; Nos. 5 and 6 the
planet Venus; No. 7, Jupiter; No. 8, Mars; and No. 11, Saturn;
No. 15 I have seen only on the casts from Sastanquiqui, Peten,

No. 1, which, however, I have copied from a potsherd brought

<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>(see p. 83) and the “claw” postfix; the South has the <i>yax</i> with
the <i>mac</i> superfix and sometimes an augment. Space will

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 66.</span>—The “Cuceb.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The precise purpose of these has remained obscure. Dr.
Seler has suggested that they indicate the colors which were assigned
to the four directions. This is true as far as it goes, but
does not explain many of their uses. My own studies have led me
to believe they are primarily “directive signs,” intended to guide
the learner in the use of the calendar wheel. This was somewhat
intricate, made by the superposition of two surfaces, the lower
marked with the cardinal points, etc., the upper, I take it, with
these directive signs. That any quarter in the native astrology
could be transferred into any other, explains why they are all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>found with all the signs of the cardinal points.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c014'><sup>[138]</sup></a> My view is
borne out by the Books of Chilan Balam. In this work the
rotation of the time-periods is called <i>cuceb</i>,
“the squirrel,” and their beginning is
marked with the Fig. <a href='#fig_66'>66</a>. This is identical
with several variants of the North “directive
sign” above; and the reason it was called
<i>cuceb</i> was that the verb <i>cucul</i> means “to
move round and round” as they did their
calendar wheels.</p>

<p class='c000'>These four directive signs occur repeatedly as affixes. They
may be read, (1) ideographically: either as directions, south,
east, north, west; or for colors, yellow, red, white, black; or, (2)
ikonomatically: for the homonyms of the names of these colors,
that is, for the other meanings of the color names. These are
numerous. Thus, <i>kan</i>, yellow, also means “jewels, money, food,
abundance, a rope, a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hamac</span>;” <i>chac</i>, red, may also signify
“strong, water, rain, the rain god, a tempest;” <i>zac</i>, white, is
also an intensive particle, “much, very,” and is close to <i>zacal</i>, to
weave, a web, and <i>zacan</i>, bread; while <i>ek</i>, black, may also be
translated “dark, darkness, a star, dyewood, the fat of meat.”
The sign for the East, the flint knife, may as such have the
values assigned above to that object (see p. 89). This, however,
does not make the method so complicated as one may think, for
in all rebus-writing we find the ordinary signs employed are
limited to a few recognized meanings.</p>

<h3 id='h109' class='c012'>5. <i>The Hieroglyphs of the Days.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>In my work on “The Native Calendar of Central America”
I pointed out that the hieroglyphs of the names of the days are
to be looked upon as rebuses, and therefore do not tell us the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>real meaning of the name given the day. They are merely the
pictures of some familiar visible object or objects, the name of
which has more or less similarity to the name of the day, and
would serve by an ocular representation to recall it to mind. To
repeat what I there said on this essential point: “It is quite
misleading to seek the real meaning or derivation of a day-name
or other word from the figure which represents it in the hieroglyphic
writing. The latter usually stands for a word of an entirely
different meaning, the only connection being a more or
less similarity of sound.”<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c014'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It should be remembered, therefore, that some of these hieroglyphics
of the day-names recur as independent characters with
other than calendar significations.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>Kan.</i> The object represented is a polished stone, shell pendant,
or bead, in Maya, <i>kan</i>. It was their circulating medium,
and it stands for <i>money</i>, and all which that magic word conveys,—food,
prosperity, abundance.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c014'><sup>[140]</sup></a> The dot or eye in the upper
portion is the perforation by which it was strung on a cord.
Others explain it as an eye (Seler); a tooth (Brasseur); a grain
of maize (Schellhas).</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <i>Chicchan.</i> The allusive design to suggest the name is supplied
by the twisted threads <i>chich kuch</i>.  See above, p. 96.
Brasseur sees in it a petticoat, Seler a serpent’s skin, etc.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>4. <i>Manik.</i> Correctly explained by Brasseur as a hand in the
act of grasping, “une main qui se ferme.” Its phonetic value is
not <i>kab</i>, hand, but <i>mach</i>, “to grasp” (see above p. 83).</p>

<img src='images/illus-111d.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>5. <i>Lamat.</i> The figures bear a close resemblance to some of
the sun signs. See Fig. <a href='#fig_37'>37</a>. They seem to show the orb partly
below a line—the horizon—which would give as a rebus <i>lamal
kin</i>, the sunsetting; enough to recall the day name.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id052'>
<img src='images/illus-111e.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>6. <i>Muluc.</i> The day sign <i>muluc</i> and the month sign <i>mol</i> have a
resemblance, as do the words. The root <i>mol</i> or <i>mul</i> means a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>coming together, or piling up. The hurricane is called <i>molay
ik</i>, “the winds united;” the word for religion is <i>umolay</i>, literally,
“a congregation or meeting.” Both signs seem to portray
one thing inside of another of the same kind, with a probable
reference to the sense of the root.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 67.</span>—A Cartouche.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>7. <i>Oc.</i> Among its various meanings this word signifies “a
trail” and “footprints.” Such seems the design in the first
variant. Brasseur, and, following him, Seler, think that the
others portray the ears of a dog, as in
some Mayan dialects the dog is called
<i>oc</i>. The full glyph is thus: <img src='images/illus-112c.jpg' alt='' class='ig' />
It is of frequent occurrence in such a
cartouche as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_67'>67</a>, where <i>a</i>
is the strengthened <i>pax</i>; (See p. 92),
<i>b</i>, the dog sign; <i>c</i>, the haunch of venison;
and <i>d</i>, the monogram of Xmucane
with a vigesimal or personal prefix.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. <i>Chuen.</i> The figure is that of a mouth, <i>chi</i>, with fangs; but
as that was not very near in sound, a calabash, <i>chu</i>, is sometimes
portrayed at the bottom of the circle, within. The mouth of no
particular animal is intended, as is evident from allied designs;
though Brasseur and Seler claim that it is of a monkey, Schellhas,
of a snake, etc. The day name is close in sound to <i>chun</i>,
the first, the beginning, and appears occasionally as a numeral
(see above, p. 23). Piles of <i>chuen</i> are shown as offerings, <i>e. g.</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Cod. Dres., pp. 26, 42; Cod. Cort., p. 3. Do they mean “first

</div>

<p class='c000'>9. <i>Eb.</i> The face of an old man with a peculiar pointed ear
mark. The word <i>eb</i> means “ladder;” <i>ebtun</i>, a stone stairway;
<i>ebzah</i>, to sharpen or point a flint; this last may explain the
sharpened ear and dots.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id047'>
<img src='images/illus-113b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>10. <i>Ben</i>, or <i>Been</i>. Explained by Brasseur as showing a path,
<i>be</i>; by Seler, as a mat and a straw roof. To me, it looks like a
<i>be che</i>, a wooden bridge, the two supports of which are shown
and which was sometimes covered with a straw mat. This rebus
gives the first syllable of the name. In Tzental tradition <i>Been</i>
was the ancient hero who erected the inscribed stelæ (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">piedras
paradas</span>) at Quixté, near Comitan,<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c014'><sup>[142]</sup></a> which the natives still decorate
at certain times with garlands of flowers, etc.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c014'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>11. <i>Ix.</i> The usual figure contains a number of black dots.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>These suggest the word <i>xiix</i>, scattered grain husks. Seler thinks
it shows “the round hairy ear and spotted skin of the jaguar.”
Brasseur proposed that it conventionally portrays the feminine
parts, as <i>ix</i> is the feminine prefix in Maya.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. <i>Cib.</i> Brasseur and Seler believe the enclosed spiral represents
the fermented liquor, <i>ci</i>, trickling down. The “pottery
decoration” (see p. 58) certainly indicates a jar or vase.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. <i>Caban.</i> The design is that of the “cork-screw curl” of
a woman, and stands for <i>cab</i> (see p. 99).</p>

<img src='images/illus-115a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>16. <i>Cauac.</i> The design shows a side face, with pendent
clouds for the eye, the “windcross” for the ear, and, perhaps,
as Seler thinks, the hairy mouth of the <i>moan</i> bird. On the
other hand, Rosny explains it as “the plan of a building,” and
Thomas as “the sign for wood.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id059'>

</div>

<p class='c000'>18. <i>Imix.</i> Generally regarded as representing a mammary
gland, though it is not quite like those shown in the Codices.
It is typical of prosperity and is often attached to the <i>kan</i> sign.
In the calendar it indicated the beginning of a time-period.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c014'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<img src='images/illus-115d.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>19. <i>Ik.</i> The word means air, wind, breath, spirit, soul, and
life. The design is a katun enclosing the sign of the four directions
or four winds, the “wind-cross.” Brasseur calls it a flower,
because it is sometimes shown with what looks like leaves emerging
from it (Cod Tro., pp. 5*, 6*, etc.). This indicates, however,
the spirit of life coming forth (or, as Seler thinks, is a sign of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>sacrifice; the same superfix occurs on the <i>kan</i>, Cod. Cort., p. 37,
etc.).</p>

<img src='images/illus-116a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>20. <i>Akbal.</i> The word resembles <i>akab</i>, night, and is probably
derived from it. The design may be that of a mouth with teeth
(Brasseur, Seler), or the rays of the sun after sinking below the
horizon. As a general glyph it is frequent with the signification
of night and darkness, not necessarily in a bad sense.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>6. <i>The Hieroglyphs for the Months.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>These are more intricate than those of the days, and show
wider variation. In the designs given below, the first on the
line is from Landa’s work, the second and third are from the
Dresden Codex.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id062'>
<img src='images/illus-116b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>Pop.</i> The word means “a mat.” The principal element in
the glyph is the south or yellow sign, referring perhaps to the
color of a mat, with the alar subfix. The prefix to the first
variant shows the “windcross.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id063'>
<img src='images/illus-116c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>2. <i>Uo.</i> The usual meaning of this term is a prickly pear;
also, a species of frog; <i>uooh</i>, a written character or letter. The
prefix indicating speech (see p. 98) seems to indicate the
latter. The chief element is the <i>mol</i> sign with the night sun as
a subfix.</p>

<img src='images/illus-117a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>3. <i>Zip.</i> The design shows the sun below the flint knife, that
is, the slain or departed sun, a play on the phrase, <i>zipik kin</i>, the
sun set (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ponerse el sol</span>, <cite>Dicc. Motul</cite>). The idea is strengthened
by the <i>mac</i> as a prefix, signifying “to extinguish.”</p>

<p class='c000'>4. <i>Zodz.</i> The word means “bat,” and the design shows the

<img src='images/illus-117c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>5. <i>Zec</i>, or <i>Tzec</i>. The design is explained by Brasseur as a
death’s head, Maya, <i>tzekel</i>; by others, as an open mouth with
teeth (compare <i>chuen</i>, p. 112). The projecting curved lines above
the head are supposed by Schellhas to represent a peculiar mode
of wearing the hair. But as <i>tzec</i> means “scorpion,” they may
depict conventionally the claws of that animal.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c014'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>6. <i>Xul.</i> The three signs are quite unlike. The first presents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the conical bill of a bird of the finch or sparrow family; the
second, the horned owl or the falcon (?); the third, a conventionalized
bird’s head. The second may be ikonomatic for
<i>xulub</i>, horns. The word <i>xul</i> means to end or to finish; and, the
end, limit, or extremity.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. <i>Yaxkin.</i> This means “new sun” or “strong sun.” The
glyph expresses this by the <i>yax</i> sign, “new” or “strong;” the
<i>kin</i> (sun) sign and the dotted postfix, <i>ual</i>, month. According
to the Dicc. Motul, the phrase <i>dze yax kin</i> was applied by the
Mayas to the hottest part of the summer.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. <i>Mol.</i> See remarks on the day sign <i>muluc</i>, p. 111. Dr.
Förstemann suggests that the above designs represent either
(1) a snail in its shell, or (2) an egg with its yolk, or (3) the
sun after setting. Seler holds that it shows the heart, Maya, <i>ol</i>,

<p class='c000'>9. <i>Ch’en.</i> This means a spring or well of water. The second
sign shows a water jar bearing the sign of fluid, with reference
to the sense of the word. The first is more complex. The
main element is a face with a <i>moan</i> mouth, referring to water;
for an eye the infix <i>u</i>, for month; and two prefixes, the sign of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>union (see p. 100), and above it what may be a variant of <i>ben</i>

The second, not plain, is a variant of the <i>kan</i> or <i>imix</i>, with the

rite of <i>tupp kak</i>, “the extinguishing of the fire,” the aim of which

it as portraying “from one point two flashes of lightning

<h3 class='c012'>7. <i>The Hieroglyphs of the Deities.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>I have already mentioned that in the texts the gods are severally
represented by their signs or monograms. The credit of
defining these in a clear and satisfactory manner is due almost
entirely to Dr. Schellhas, and I shall here present the results of

Two of them are usually written. The prefix to 1 and 3 has
been already referred to (see p. 84). The bean (or flint)

associated with his monogram is No. 5, which Seler explains as
the sign of the owl. No. 6, from Cod. Dres., p. 50, with a skull

symbols, Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15, are often connected with him.
Some regard them as the four elements, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>C.</i> The North Star, or “the god with the ornamental face.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus-122b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is easy to recognize his monogram, Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19, 21.
I have already explained the “pottery decoration” (above, p.
58). As prefixes, we find the bean, No. 20; the crescent, as in
21; the number 13, indicating completeness or perfection; and
the vase, as in 16 and 17.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>D.</i> Cuculcan, “the moon god, or night god.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id072'>
<img src='images/illus-122c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The complete hieroglyph is No. 22, generally followed by No.
23. He is “the old man god,” with one tooth, as in No. 24;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>sometimes connected with the moon symbol as in No. 25; and
often holds in his hand the aspersorium, shown in Nos. 26 and
27. See p. 105.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>E.</i> Ghanan, “a male maize god.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id073'>
<img src='images/illus-123a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>His usual monogram is No. 28. No. 29 is a picture of the
maize plant from Cod. Tro., p. 29, from which Dr. Schellhas
argues that the head-dresses of this divinity, as shown in Nos. 30–34,
are conventional designs for growing maize. My own collations
persuade me that the maize should here be understood
as a general symbol for vegetable growth, fertility, and the
harvests.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>F.</i> The god of War, or, “a companion of the god of death.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id071'>
<img src='images/illus-123b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>His hieroglyphs, shown in Nos. 35–41, often contain the number
11. The black line is characteristic. His signs appear in
connection with all four cardinal points.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>G.</i> Kin ich, “the sun god.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id074'>
<img src='images/illus-123c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>His monogram is uniform No. 42. It is the sun with the
<i>ben ik</i> superfix and alar postfix. (See p. 90). His nose ornament,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>No. 43, and the “flower,” No. 44, are usually distinctive
of his portraits.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c014'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><i>I.</i> “The serpent goddess.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her signs are not distinct. Dr. Schellhas believes them to be
Nos. 49–51; but I cannot accept that they are intended for the
same individual.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>H.</i> “The serpent god.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id075'>
<img src='images/illus-124a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The hieroglyph and the personage, No. 45, are doubtful. He
is supposed to be shown in Cod. Dres., pp. 11, 12, 20, etc. Nos.
46 and 47, from Cod. Tro., p. 17, are also assigned him. The
rattle, No. 48, appears as a hieroglyph in Cod. Dres., p. 61, and
elsewhere. I doubt this deity.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>K.</i> “The god with the ornamented nose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The hieroglyph is No. 52, often accompanied by the “dog”
sign, No. 53. I have already expressed the belief that this is
merely one of the manifestations of Itzamna. (See p. 54.)</p>

<p class='c000'><i>L.</i> Ical Ahau, “a black god.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id030'>
<img src='images/illus-124b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Schellhas distinguishes between a divinity whose sign is
No. 54, and “<i>M</i>,” “a second black god,” whose hieroglyph is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>No. 55, 56, and whose face is shown No. 57. He appears in
Cod. Dres., pp. 13, 16, 43, and is common in the Cod. Tro. The
sign No. 58 is occasionally associated, as in Cod. Tro., p. 5, and
Cod. Cort., p. 28.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>N.</i> “A god with the features of an old man.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id075'>
<img src='images/illus-125a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>His sign is No. 59, which may be translated “5 Zac,” and may
refer to his festival on that date (Seler). His face and peculiar
head-dress, with the <i>pax</i> sign, are shown No. 60. These do not
strike me as representing divinity, but simply “old age.”</p>

<p class='c000'><i>O.</i> “A goddess with features of an old woman” (Xmucane?).
Her hieroglyphs are shown Nos. 61, 62; the latter is more frequent.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>P.</i> “A figure with features of an old man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is seen Cod. Dres., p. 21, with the sign No. 63. It is
doubtful if a deity is intended.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Q.</i> “An isolated deity.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Shown Cod. Dres., p. 20, with the signs Nos. 64 and 65;
probably a mere personage.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>R.</i> The <i>moan</i> bird.</p>

<p class='c000'>He is often associated with the god of death, and bears the
hieroglyphs Nos. 66–69, sometimes with the 13.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>S.</i> No. 70 is the usual hieroglyph of the dog, and <i>T</i>, No. 71,
is that of the vulture.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span><i>U.</i> No. 72 is the sign of the jaguar, as seen in Cod. Tro., p.

  <h2 class='c005'>V. Specimens of Texts.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the selection of the following texts I have been guided
principally by the desire to illustrate Mayan palæography as
presented on different surfaces, paper, stone, earthenware, etc.,
and as it is found in the various regions occupied by tribes of
Mayan culture and affinity. Some of the examples have not
been previously published, and for this reason have a special
value.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 68.</span>—The God of Time brings in the Dead Year. (From the Dresden Codex.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Fig. <a href='#fig_68'>68</a> I would explain as the god of time bringing in the
dead year. It is part of the ceremonies depicted as belonging
to the close of the year. That the wolf-headed figure represents
time, the Devourer, I infer from its relations in the early pages
of the Ferjevary Codex, where it is shown eating a string of
days, etc. (in Kingsborough’s <cite>Mexican Antiquities</cite>).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>These ceremonies are represented in the Cod. Troano, pp.
20–23, and the Cod. Dres., pp. 25–28. The recognition of
their significance is principally due to Prof. Cyrus Thomas.</p>

<p class='c000'>The god arrives in the vase of the heavenly waters. In his left
hand he holds the rattle, in his right the magic wand, or magician’s
staff, <i>caluac</i>, and the medicine bag (Maya <i>chimil</i>, Nahuatl,
<i>xiquipilli</i>); around his waist is the broad carrying-band, in the
loop of which he has the dying year, <i>kan</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In Fig. <a href='#fig_69'>69</a> is another scene from the same ceremonies. The
person on the right is the celebrant, holding a beheaded fowl in
his right hand, while his left strews grain. Before him is a
haunch of venison and a turkey. Above the latter is the moon
symbol with the number 15. To the left of these stands the
statue of Mam, the Grandfather, a log folded in a robe and surmounted
by the leaves of the Tree of Life.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c014'><sup>[148]</sup></a> In front are seen
the serpent’s head, the sign of Time; below this are footprints,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>to indicate that time is gone; and beneath the form of the god
is the sign <i>pax</i>, with the meaning, “it is ended.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In interesting contrast to these two is Fig. <a href='#fig_70'>70</a>, showing the
beginning of a time-period. On the left, two dogs, back to back
beneath the same canopy, indicate the closing of one period
and the beginning of another. On the right, the serpent of time,
resting on the earth, brings to the heavens the new sun. The
youthful god between the serpent’s jaws carries the world-sign
for an eye, and holds in his hand the symbol <i>yax kin</i>, “new
sun.” Above are appropriate hieroglyphs, the tenor of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the diligent student of my previous pages will have little difficulty
in catching.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Fig. <a href='#fig_71'>71</a> the God of Growth and Fertility holds an elaborate
<i>caluac</i> surmounted by a bird, its apertures filled with shells. Behind
him is seated the God of Death, his <i>caluac</i> tipped with a
formidable spear-head. The God of Growth has not his own
monogram, but that of the old Cuculcan.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we recall that the shell is the sign for “nought,” the
indication seems that the God of Death with his spear will bring
to nought the efforts of the God of Fertility.</p>

<p class='c000'>We see in Fig. <a href='#fig_72'>72</a> the North Star in a series of relations to
other celestial bodies or divinities. Beginning at the left, he is
seated on his own sign which is surrounded by rays; next, he
is upon the sign of the four winds and four quarters of the earth;
in the third he is suspended in a sling from the “constellation
band” between the sun and a planet; and fourth, he is above the
clouds, which rest upon a canopy protecting a pile of <i>kans</i>,
money or food emblems.</p>

<p class='c000'>The three figures in Fig. <a href='#fig_73'>73</a> present the beneficent deities,
each bearing in the hand the food symbol, <i>kan</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The group copied in Fig. <a href='#fig_74'>74</a>, show the God of Death followed
by Kin ich, who seems remonstrating with him, who in
turn is followed by the God of War with a wrathful visage. The
positions of the hands are especially noteworthy. The sign <i>mol</i>
leads each of the cartouches.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Fig. <a href='#fig_75'>75</a> Cuculcan is making fire from the friction of two
pieces of wood. On his head is the <i>moan</i> symbol, on his thigh
the <i>kin</i>. Each of the three cartouches begins with the drum
sign. His own monogram is the third member of the second
cartouche.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Fig. <a href='#fig_76'>76</a> the text is the same in each of the three cartouches
except the monograms of the three divinities represented.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>There is some reason to suppose, however, that in this
part of the Mayan territory there had been a development of
this writing until it had become conventionalized into a series of

<p class='c000'>The tablets at Palenque are too extensive a study for me to
enter upon in the present work. The engraving, Fig. <a href='#fig_80'>80</a>, is
merely to show the character of the writing and to present the
“initial glyphs,” upon which, in Copan and elsewhere, Mr.
Maudslay lays so much stress (see above, p. 23).</p>

<p class='c000'>Incidentally, they seem to me to prove that the proper reading
of the tablet is to begin at the top of the two right-hand columns,
read them together downward (as Thomas suggested), then the
next two to the left in a similar manner; but the last two on the
left, those headed by the great <i>pax</i>, should be read from below
upward. This differs from any scheme yet proposed, but alone
corresponds with the natural sequences of the groups of glyphs.
The terminal (upper left) glyph shows the <i>pax</i> surmounted by
the <i>xihuitl</i> and this by the “trinal” signs. The student of the
preceding pages will not be at a loss to explain their purport.</p>

The original, formerly in the possession of Don Secundino
Orantes, in the city of Chiapas, measures 26 by 17 inches. The
front is badly injured, but the back well preserved. We find in
this cartouche of twenty glyphs enough familiar forms to convince

<p class='c000'>The limits which I have prescribed for this work do not permit
me to add further comparisons in Mayan palæography.
Fortunately, the student can find ready access to abundant
examples. The inscriptions of Copan and Quiriguá, of Chichen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Itza, and Palenque, are or will be represented with admirable
fidelity in Mr. Maudslay’s work already referred to; others from
Tikal have been made accessible by the labors of Berendt, Charnay
and de Rosny; and we are justified in believing that before many
years the intelligent explorations of competent archæologists
will add hundreds of texts from the relics in stone, clay, and
wood which still exist to attest the character of ancient Mayan
literature.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c000'>The most urgent duty resting upon the present generation of
students interested in this subject is to collect and accurately
reproduce as many of these texts as possible, before they are
destroyed or lost. Extended comparisons will ultimately reveal
their meaning, as will readily be seen from the advances in that
direction chronicled in the preceding pages.</p>

phonetic system is consistent with the known differences of dialects in the Mayan
stock, is a question which space does not permit me to enter upon. I can only say
that the signification seems to me to have been fixed in the Maya-Tzental district,
and thence carried to the Chortis, Quiches, etc.</p>

the competent editorship of Juan de Dios de la Rada y Delgado, in 1884. On the

used to designate the particular day which falls on the 20th of the month, that is, the
last day of the month, and has therefore the sense of “last,” “final,” rather than of 20.
It is written as an affix to the month sign. Thomas states that it is used with month
symbols “only where the month (of 20 days) is complete or follows one completed.”

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r22'>22</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since the above was written, Mr. Stewart Culin, Director of the museum of the
University of Pennsylvania, has called my attention to the fact that the cross-hatching
on the “cosmic sign” would, in Oriental, especially Chinese symbolism, convey the
idea of the fundamental dual principles of existence,—male and female, upper and
lower, etc. The same interpretation may quite possibly apply in the Mayan symbolism.</p>

sense, as <i>hun miatz</i>, “the one scholar,” <i>i. e.</i>, the most distinguished. Why a
symbolic or superlative sense was attached to such numbers is a question too extensive
to discuss here. I have touched upon it in my <cite>Native Calendar of Central
America</cite>, pp. 8, 13, and in an article on “The Origin of Sacred Numbers” in <cite>The
American Anthropologist</cite>, April, 1894. In another connection we find <i>maay</i>, odor

heavens; but offers no evidence that the Mayas entertained the Nahuatl myth to
which this refers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r26'>26</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To enter into this debated question at length would not be possible in this connection;
but I would merely note: (1) The positive assertion of Landa that the
Maya year “invariably” began July 16 (<cite><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Cosas de Yucatan</span></cite>, p. 236), could not be
true even for five years, unless the bissextile correction was made, which he asserts
was done; (2) the example of a Maya year given by Aguilar (<cite><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Informe contra
Idolum Cultores del Obispado de Yucatan</span></cite>, Madrid, 1639), is actually one containing
six intercalary days, “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>seis</i> dias que fueron sus caniculares</span>;” and (3) Father Martin
de Leon, in his “<cite><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Calendario Mexicano</span></cite>,” pointedly states that the fourth year was a
bissextile year (<cite><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Camino del Cielo</span></cite>, fol. 100, Mexico, 1611). I do not maintain that
this knowledge was general, but that it had been acquired by the astronomer-priests
of certain localities. The investigations of Mrs. Zelia Nuttall tend to demonstrate
this opinion.</p>

that the same calendar system, based, he believes, on the year of 365 days, was used
in Palenque, Menche (Lorillard City), and Tikal, as well as in the Cod. Dresdensis.
That the Mayas had, at the time of the Conquest, long known the year of 365 days,
was demonstrated from the Codices by Dr. Förstemann. (See his <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erläuterungen zur

is that it is a “snake rain god,” “probably Cuculcan,” “parallel with Tlaloc.”

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
